            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Your main Work is <hi>Settlement,</hi> as <hi>Healers of the Breaches.</hi> And our Wounds call for <hi>Lenitives,</hi> not <hi>Corroſives.</hi> Now is the time to ſhew the depth of Wiſdome, not height of Animoſity; to ſeek peace and purſue it, not to be for warr: and, to <hi>let your moderation to be known to all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You cannot be ignorant that there ever have been, and will be many Quack-Salving ſpirits, who fancying to themſelves new Models of Government for ſiniſter ends, think You to be very weak if You differ from them. Such will never be for any ſettlement at all; but, run up and down both City and Country, like ſo many <hi>Ignes fatui,</hi> to inveagle well-meaning men (ignorant of their devices) to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe their Factious Petitions. Wherein, under pretence of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, they deſigne to make You, firſt, to hold the ſtirrup; and then to be their footſtool, to get themſelves into the ſaddle.</p>
            <p>Little do thoſe turbulent Polypragmatiſts <hi>know of what ſpirit they are:</hi> much leſs do they conſider that <hi>Ignatius Loyola</hi> ever lies at the bottome of all thoſe Diviſions which their ſeditious zeal would kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle among You. But I truſt Your Wiſdome will timely ſee through ſuch ſelf-ended Projects, and reſolutely reject ſuch deſtructive En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devours to Divide You, that they might reign.</p>
            <p>If Your Counſels miſcarry: and, in ſtead of quenching old fires, new flames break out; Woe, woe to this Nation. For that, in all likelihood, (unleſs men will tempt God to work Miracles as the Devil did Chriſt, <hi>to command Bread out of Stones</hi>) this will devour Us. And then, who ſhall ſave You? <hi>I beſeech You</hi> (therefore) <hi>to mark thoſe that cauſe Diviſions and offences, and avoid them. For they that are
<pb facs="tcp:49617:3"/> ſuch, ſerve not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but their own belly; and, by good words, and fair ſpeeches, deceive the hearts of the ſimple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pardon this boldneſs in him that hath, by the ſpace of 40 years, been a diligent Obſerver of, and a faithfull ſervant to Parliaments, ſo farr as they ſeriouſly ſought the Publick Good; and ſo reſolveth to be to You. Upon which account, he humbly maketh this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs: The occaſion, this.</p>

For this, They, their Agents, and all purchaſers are proclaimed guilty of that odious ſin of <hi>Sacriledge;</hi> and none more than this Your ſervant. Hereupon, he hath often been preſſed to Vindicate the Parliament, and thereby to right himſelf, who hath long felt the ſcourge of tongues, and been made to drink the gaul of Pens, for purchaſing ſome of thoſe <hi>Lands;</hi> and, for his juſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to poſſeſs what he hath paid for, by ſome moſt unjuſtly detained from him, in the judgments of the honourable, firſt, the <hi>Committe of Parliament;</hi> and after, <hi>the Commiſſioners, for Removing Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions in the ſale of thoſe Lands.</hi> Which laſt (being by ſpecial Act of Parliament impoured thereunto) have <hi>Heard</hi> and <hi>Determined</hi> the ſame: but, to no purpoſe, if Contempt may prevail.</p>
            <p>Both theſe, are here faithfully ſpread before You; not by way of Complaint, but of Account: You being the moſt proper Patrons of the <hi>Vindication</hi> of a <hi>Parliament;</hi> and beſt able to judge both of their <hi>frauds</hi> that have abuſed the State; and, of their <hi>Contumacy</hi> who being, upon a full Hearing, Ordered to Reconvey what they have fraudulently gotten into their Conveyance, refuſe to obey any Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders whatſoever.

            <p>Now, the Good Lord make You all, <hi>men that have underſtanding of the times, to know what Iſrael ought to do:</hi> And, ſo temper Your ſpirits, and govern Your Councels, that You may be ſuch a Bleſſing to this Nation, as that the Children yet Unborn may <hi>call You Bleſſed.</hi> This is, and ſhall be the daily prayer of him, that (without art or private ends) is,</p>

But, that <hi>Loan</hi> not ſufficing, another <hi>Act</hi> paſſed the ſame yeer, for <hi>Subſcriptions</hi> of moneys to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured for the Lands of thoſe Rebels upon certain <hi>Propoſitions,</hi> for more ſpeedy ſubduing of them. To this Dr. <hi>Burges</hi> ſubſcribed, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly paid in 700<hi>l.</hi> more.</p>
            <p>The next yeer after, that Unhappy Difference between the late King and his Parliament, brake out alſo. And, the Parliament <hi>Declaring</hi> that the King (ſeduced by evil Counſel) had deſerted them, raiſed an Army againſt them, and erected his <hi>Standard</hi> of War at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> whereby he had put both <hi>Parliament</hi> and <hi>Kingdom</hi> out of his Protection; the ſaid Parliament publiſhed the Neceſſity of an <hi>Advance</hi> of Money,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49617:4"/> Horſes and Plate, by a voluntary <hi>Loan,</hi> upon the <hi>Publike Faith, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the King and Parliament,</hi> and for bringing to condign Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thoſe evil Counſellours about the King, which had engaged him in that deſtructive Deſign. Dr. <hi>Burges</hi> taking notice of this Declaration, out of the integrity of his heart to the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> lent ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſums of Money, for defence of both; being reſolved to have ſuffered any death, rather than to have lent one peny, or to have ſpoken one word in that Cauſe, upon any other account: as he after expreſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed and proteſted to a Committee of that Parliament ſitting to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine him (among others) touching a Printed <hi>Vindication</hi> of the Miniſters in and about <hi>London,</hi> that had been unjuſtly charged with having ſome hand in promoting the late Kings Death.</p>
            <p>And whereas by that Diſmal Diviſion, ſharp and bitter Wars had been, for ſome yeers waged, and vaſt ſums of Money (raiſed on the <hi>Publike Faith</hi>) exhauſted, the Parliament held themſelves bound in honour and juſtice to pay thoſe debts, contracted by that War, mainly promoted againſt the Parliament and Kingdom (if not by, yet) in favour of the <hi>Arch-biſhops and Biſhops</hi> (one of them having called the fore-runner of it, <hi>Bellum Epiſcopale,</hi> or the Biſhops War:) therefore the Parliament paſſed an Ordinance, <hi>Octob.</hi> 9. 1646. for an abſolute taking away, and <hi>aboliſhing</hi> the <hi>Name, Title, Dignity, and Office of Arch-biſhops and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> who (having before incurred a <hi>Praemunire</hi>) were thenceforth ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly diſabled to hold or exerciſe the place or function of Arch-biſhops or Biſhops within <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Wales.</hi> And their Lands, and Poſſeſſions held in right of their Biſhopricks (being by that abolition eſcheted) were veſted in certain Truſtees; <hi>ſubject to ſuch Truſts as both Houſes of Parliament ſhould appoint and declare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which Parliament, by another Ordinance, of <hi>Novemb.</hi> 16. 1646. ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and ordained all thoſe Lands and Revenues to be ſold, for raiſing of 200000<hi>l.</hi> for the then preſent uſe of the State. In which Ordinance they invited all that had before lent Money, Horſes, Plate, &amp;c. for the Service of the King and Parliament, upon the <hi>Publike Faith,</hi> to <hi>double</hi> the ſame: and ſo, to take the whole ſo doubled, out of Biſhops Lands, either in Money or Lands. For which purpoſe, they engaged the Grand Exciſe, and Biſhops Lands: not without intimation, that ſuch as doubled not, muſt exſpect no other ſecurity for what they had lent, but the then-deſpiſed <hi>Publike Faith;</hi> nor to be paid, till all <hi>Doublers</hi> were ſatisfyed.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Burges</hi> ſeeing this neceſſity of doubling, to prevent hazzarding of all, doubled all his Bils, which (upon doubling) amounted to 3400<hi>l.</hi> beſide his <hi>Loan</hi> and adventures for <hi>Ireland.</hi> All which, he endeavoured to receive back in Money, but was therein hindred by ſuch as laboured all they could to engage him in the taking of it out in <hi>Biſhops Lands.</hi> He therefore, having a wife, and ten children to provide for, that muſt all be undone, if that money miſcarryed; and finding the Diviſions of Parties that now managed the Publike, and purſued ſeveral Intereſts, to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49617:4"/> be daily encreaſed, and more heightened, and himſelf ill requited for all his faithful Service, was put upon this ſtrait, to take out his Moneys in <hi>Biſhops Lands.</hi> This was the only reaſon of his purchaſing of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Lands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since which <hi>purchaſe,</hi> it hath pleaſed the Wiſe God to exerciſe him with many ſharpe afflictions; among which <hi>the ſcourge of tongues</hi> hath not been leaſt.

            <p>He intended no more in that ſpeech, then what he had long before<note n="x" place="margin">

               </note>1. <hi>Tythes</hi> are called by God himſelf, <hi>his Inheritance,</hi> Deut. 18.1. where he gave to the Levites, two things, the <hi>Offerings</hi> and <hi>Tythes,</hi> for their maintenance. <hi>They ſhall eat the Offerings of the Lord made by fire, and his Inheritance;</hi> that is, the <hi>Tythes.</hi> For theſe only were <hi>his Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> which is there diſtinguiſhed from <hi>the Offerings made by fire.</hi> So he declared himſelf unto the <hi>Levites,</hi> Num. 18.24. <hi>When ye take of the children of Iſrael the Tythes, which I have given you from them for your Inheritance.</hi> He that gives them as <hi>their Inheritance,</hi> muſt firſt have a propriety himſelf in them as <hi>his own Inheritance.</hi> Hence he chargeth with <hi>ſacriledge</hi> ſuch as detained either of theſe from the Prieſts and Levites, as <hi>robbing</hi> of himſelf. <hi>Ye have robbed me in Tythes and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings</hi>
               <note n="y" place="margin">Mal 3.8.</note>.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nor was this a new Title, raiſed only for maintainance of the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi> with reference to the <hi>Levitical Service</hi> only; But Tythes were Gods due long before, and paid as God appointed, where ever he ſet up a Prieſt and publike Prieſthood, Evangelical as well as Legal. In ſo much as <hi>Levi himſelf,</hi> before he was born, is ſaid to have <hi>paid Tythes in Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
               <note n="z" place="margin">Heb 7.9.</note>. <hi>For, he was yet in the loyns of his Father when Melchiſedeck met him</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Verſ. 10.</note>. <hi>To whom the Patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the very Spoyl he had taken in War</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Verſ 4.</note>. <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> was (no Legal, but Evangelical) <hi>Prieſt of the High God,</hi> at leaſt in type. For Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is a <hi>Priest for ever</hi> of the ſame <hi>Order,</hi> and ſo hath the ſame right to <hi>Tythes,</hi> that <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> had. Of which, more by and by.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If we conſult Goſpel-times, it will appear that albeit Goſpel Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters were not in actual Poſſeſſion of Tythes, at the firſt preaching of the Goſpel, nor during the Ten grand <hi>Perſecutions,</hi> no more than were the <hi>Levites</hi> in the <hi>Wilderneſs:</hi> yet Gods right was ſtill the ſame, and he by Ordinance ſetled them upon the Miniſters of Chriſt, even from the firſt calling them to preach. For, as of old, <hi>They that miniſtred about holy things, lived of the things of the Temple; and they which waited at the Altar, were partakers with the Altar: even ſo hath the Lord ORDAINED, that they which preach the Goſpel ſhould live of the Goſpel,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.13, 14.</p>
            <p>Hence the ſame Apoſtle who wrote this to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> gives it in charge to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> (and in them, to all) that had <hi>received the Goſpel,</hi> that <hi>every one that is taught in the Word,</hi> ſee <hi>that he communicate unto him that teacheth, in all good things,</hi> Gal. 6.6. At that time, Chriſts proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49617:7"/> in Tythes, could not be available to Miniſters, there being no Laws among them, to recover them. Therefore He requires them for that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to lay out ſuch maintenance as they could well raiſe; yet ſo, as they ſhould communicate <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>in,</hi> or <hi>of all their goods,</hi> (as ſome not improperly tranſlate the Original:) as the Iſraelites did to the Levites at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the Ark, in the <hi>Wilderneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Neither that laſt mentioned Ordinance of God, nor the Charge gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> could extend to any <hi>Offerings made by Fire,</hi> or of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Levitical Profits, all which ceaſed, when Chriſt (our <hi>High Prieſt</hi>) had once <hi>offered Himſelf up to God,</hi> and thereby accompliſhed all which thoſe Offerings typified, and changed the <hi>Prieſt-hood.</hi> Therefore it muſt be meant of Maintenance by <hi>Tythes,</hi> ſo ſoon at leaſt, as the Goſpel ſhould be received by their Covernours, and Laws could be made for putting Gods Ordinance in Execution for that ſtanding Maintenance by Tythes; not in <hi>Levi</hi>'s right, as Succeſſors to him, but as Servants to Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That this was the Apoſtles meaning, is evident, becauſe Tythes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt paid (long before <hi>Levi</hi>) to <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> a Prieſt of Chriſts own Order; and, <hi>Abraham</hi> the <hi>Father of the Faithful,</hi> (and in him <hi>Levi</hi>) paid Tythes unto <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> as the fore-runner of Chriſt, in reſpect of Prieſthood; it neceſſarily followeth, that Tythes are ſtill due to Chriſt, in whoſe name and right, his Servants the Miniſters ought to take, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy them. For the Apoſtle, upon this very ground, proves Chriſt to be <hi>a Prieſt after the Order of Melchiſedech,</hi> not onely becauſe <hi>he liveth,</hi> but becauſe alſo <hi>he receiveth tythes. Here,</hi> ſaith he, (meaning in <hi>Judea,</hi> during <hi>Aarons</hi> Prieſthood) <hi>men that die receive tythes: but there</hi> (that is, where <hi>Melchiſedech</hi>'s Prieſthood is exerciſed) <hi>He receiveth them, of whom it is witneſſed that he liveth</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Heb. 7.8.</note>. Which he there applieth to Chriſt, and to no other.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Therefore all yearly <hi>tythes</hi> (by ſome called<note n="d" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Tbo God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win,</hi> in <hi>Moſ.</hi> &amp; <hi>Aaron</hi> lib. 6. cap. 3. of <hi>Tythes.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>the firſt tythes</hi>) are the proper ſtanding Maintenance ſet out by God, for Miniſters of the Goſpel, in all ſettled and well-governed Chriſtian Commonwealths, which in obedience to God make Laws for the due payment of them: for that they ſtill belong to Chriſt as <hi>His inheritance</hi> and portion, payable to his Miniſters, by way of homage unto him, as his right, from all his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And therefore to alien or imploy them to any other uſe (under any pretence whatſoever) is plain <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> not onely in thoſe who ſo alien them, but in them alſo who ſo poſſeſs and imploy them, if they be not Miniſters of Chriſt; or being Miniſters, preach not the Goſpel, or procure not others, (if themſelves be diſabled by age or ſickneſs) to do it: it being no other but a robbing of Chriſt, of what is his proper due, and by God made <hi>holy to himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Second Point here undertaken, is, <hi>That there is no Warrant in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for the giving of Land to Biſhops, nor Argument to prove Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of them as holy to the Lord, and that it can be no Sacriledge now to alien them.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:49617:8"/>
            <p>This Point hath two branches to be proſecuted diſtinctly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That there is no Warrant in Scripture, for the giving of Lands to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, nor Argument to prove Christs acceptance of them, as holy to the Lord.</hi> Which appeareth thus.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is no word in the New-Teſtament that requireth, or counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanceth ſuch endowments.</p>
            <p>The Ordinance for Miniſters Maintenance, recorded by St. <hi>Paul</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 9.</note> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends no further then to what was allowed to <hi>Levites,</hi> while they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued: nor, to all that neither. <hi>Offerings made by Fire,</hi> are by Chriſt extinct. It reache<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> indeed to <hi>all good things:</hi> that is, to Goods, (not Lands) in the judgement of all Expoſitors, ancient and modern, Popiſh as well as Proteſtant. It extends therefore to Tythes onely, as the conſtant ſtanding Livelyhood of <hi>Miniſters of the New Teſtament,</hi> where Tythes may be had; and, in the mean time, to ſuch other competent allowance, in <hi>Goods</hi> or <hi>Money,</hi> as could be raiſed for them.</p>
            <p>There are ſome Wyre-drawn Arguments (or rather futilous Fancies) for Proof of the extent of God's Ordinance, for Evangelical Miniſters Maintenance, even unto Lands alſo, produced by the confident Author of a printed <hi>Anſwer to a Letter ſaid to be written at Oxford, Anno</hi> 1647. ſuperſcribed to Dr. <hi>Samuel Turner,</hi> touching <hi>the change of Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Biſhops, and the alienating of their Lands.</hi> Which the ſaid Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor undertakes to prove to be <hi>impoſſible to be done with a good Conſcience.</hi> His Arguments are taken from ſundry Scriptures, <hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. [<hi>I was hungry, and ye fed me,</hi> &amp;c.] as alſo from <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.40. <hi>[He that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth you, receiveth me.]</hi> and from <hi>Act.</hi> 5. [touching <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phira</hi>] and from <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.22. <hi>[Committeſt thou Sacriledge?]</hi> But his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from thoſe Scriptures to prove what he undertakes, are ſo je june and frigid, that they deſerve no anſwer. Howbeit, <hi>leſt he ſhould be wiſe in his own conceit,</hi> let him take what followeth. That Author undertakes to prove <hi>the alienating of Church-Lands of Biſhops to be Sacriledge.</hi> To make way hereunto, he premiſeth theſe things; 1. <q rend="margQuotes">That God accepts of things given him, and hath a Propriety in them, as well in the New as in the Old Teſtament. 2. That God gets this Propriety as well by accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of voluntary gifts, as by his command for the giving of them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> Now unleſs he make it out, that Gods <hi>Acceptation</hi> and <hi>Propriety,</hi> (as he phraſeth it) reach to <hi>Church Lands of Biſhops,</hi> his labour is in vain: and his Arguments from thoſe Texts, are no other then a groſs abuſing of the Scriptures, like that of thoſe <hi>unlearned and unstable ones, who wreſt them to their own deſtruction</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">2 Pet. 3.16.</note>.</p>
            <p>His firſt Text out of <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. neither doth nor can extend to Chriſts Acceptation of, or Propriety in Church-Lands, voluntarily given to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops for their Maintenance. It ſpeaks onely of Alms, whereby the Hungry, Naked, Sick or Perſecuted Members of Chriſt are Chriſtianly relieved: Not the accepting Lands for Biſhops, (ſuch eſpecially, as that Author declareth for) who <hi>Lord it over God's Heritage,</hi> by appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſole power of <hi>Ordination,</hi> and <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> to themſelves;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49617:8"/> two of the moſt ſenſeleſs Dreams that can be fathered upon thoſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, which the ſame Authour abuſeth<note n="*" place="margin">Page 20.</note> to that purpoſe. Nor is there the leaſt hint of Chriſts <hi>Acceptation</hi> of Lands, for any Uſes whatſoever; but onely of preſent ſupplies of Food, Rayment, and other Neceſſaries, ſuitable to the inſtant wants of his diſtreſſed Members.</p>
            <p>But, ſaith he; <hi>Doth Christ thus accept of meat, and cloathing; and not of thoſe Endowments that bring theſe to perpetuity? Will he take meat, and refuſe Revenues?</hi> and he concludes it of both: adding, that it were a ſtrange thing, Chriſt ſhould take thoſe Gifts ſo kindly, for proviſions of all called <hi>His,</hi> and that <hi>onely His Apostles and His ſeventy Diſciples</hi> ſhould be excepted from ſharing therein.</p>
            <p>This would not ſeem ſtrange to him, were he not a ſtranger to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. He might by further ſearch, know, That though Chriſt accepted of <hi>Gifts for the Poor,</hi> yet when they were more then there was preſent uſe of, they were abuſed, even under Chriſts own Noſe, by that <hi>thief Judas, who bore the Bag</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">Joh. 12.6.</note>. And would it were a ſlander to ſay, That moſt of thoſe that ſince have been truſted with that <hi>Bag,</hi> and with the large Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues given to that Uſe, are too near of Kin to that firſt Treaſurer.</p>
            <p>Under the Old Teſtament God made many proviſions for the Poor; but none in Land it ſelf: And how much the Poor get by the gift of Lands (eſpecially after one Age or two) under the Goſpel, is too obvious and lamentable to behold. That Author therefore begs the Queſtion by way of a confident Interrogation <hi>[Will He take Meat, and refuſe Revenues?]</hi> which ſhould the Authour be kept from, till he prove it, he might, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, ſtarve to Death.</p>
            <p>But as for Chriſts <hi>accepting</hi> of and having a <hi>Propriety</hi> in Lands given to the Church, for Biſhops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he is out, <hi>toto Coelo,</hi> as far as the Eaſt is from the Weſt. That Chriſt took care for the Poor, is evident; and that his care was no leſs for his Miniſters, is no leſs a Truth. For he that of old made that a Law, <hi>Thou ſhalt not muzzle the mouth of the Ox, that treadeth out the Corn</hi>
               <note n="g" place="margin">Deut. 25.4.</note>; did he it as <hi>taking care</hi> (onely or chiefly) <hi>for Oxen?</hi> nay, <hi>for our ſakes no doubt is it written;</hi> yea, <hi>altogether for our ſakes,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi>
               <note n="h" place="margin">1 Cor. 9.10.</note> in behalf of all <hi>Miniſters</hi> that <hi>labour in the Word and Doctrine.</hi> Howbeit, from hence to make it good, that that Text in <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth or is extendable to Chriſts <hi>acceptance</hi> of the gift of Lands for Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or for His Apoſtles, or His ſeventy Diſciples, or any of their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, will require time till the thirtieth day of <hi>February,</hi> or the <hi>Greek Kalends</hi> come about.</p>
            <p>As for Chriſt himſelf, (although he were of the Blood-Royal, of the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neage of David,</hi> both by his Mothers ſide, and by his ſuppoſed Fathers too)<note n="i" place="margin">Luk. 2.4.</note> He profeſſeth that very <hi>Foxes</hi> and <hi>Birds</hi> were better provided then He; for the one had <hi>Holes,</hi> the other <hi>Nests,</hi> but he had not ſo much as a Room or Pillow on which He might <hi>lay His Head</hi>
               <note n="k" place="margin">Mat. 8.20.</note>: And when He ſent out the <hi>Twelve,</hi> His charge was<note n="l" place="margin">Mat. 10.9.10.</note>, <hi>Provide neither Gold, nor Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, nor Braſs in your Purſes, nor Scrip for your journey, neither two Coats,</hi> &amp;c. Not, that He meant to ſtarve them: for He took care that provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49617:9"/> ſhould be made for their preſent ſupply, by thoſe to whom they prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, ſo as they wanted nothing<note n="m" place="margin">Luk 22.35.</note>: and that upon this account, <hi>That the labourer is worthy of his hire</hi>
               <note n="n" place="margin">Mat. 10.10.</note>. May it not then, upon better grounds, be retorted, <hi>Chriſt would accept of no Lands or Houſe for Himſelf, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad even Gold and Silver to His Apostles, therefore he will not accept, own, or hold the Lands of Biſhops, eſpecially of ſuch as he never owned?</hi> Not that it is unlawful now, for Miniſters that preach the Goſpel, to receive allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but that thoſe words of our Lord, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. had no relation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p>And albeit (if we give credit to <hi>Platina, Petrus de Natalibus,</hi> and others) Pope <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> 1. about the year of Chriſt 233. by an Epiſtle <hi>Decretal,</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, That the Church might enjoy <hi>praedia, quorum proventibus alendos ſtatuit Eccleſiae Miniſtros,</hi> &amp;c. Poſſeſſions, out of which Profits, he appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Miniſters of the Church to be maintained; and forbad the aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thereof, under pain of Excommunication: which Pope <hi>Lucius</hi> 1. after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards<note n="o" place="margin">
                  <hi>An.</hi> 255.</note> ſeconded; and <hi>Pius</hi> 2. long after him<note n="p" place="margin">
                  <hi>An.</hi> 1459.</note> confirmed as a Law. Yet he that ſhall trace the beſt Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtories, ſhall finde, that the Church was endowed with no Lands, even in the greateſt advancement of Biſhops by <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great. It is true, that in the ſuppoſitious <hi>Donation of Conſtantine,</hi> it is ſaid, That upon the Churches which he ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the honour of the bleſſed Apoſtles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul, poſſeſſionum praedia contulit,</hi> he conferred the ſpoils of Poſſeſſions (gotten by War:) Yet this, in the Language of thoſe times, and of the <hi>Civil</hi> Law, did not extend to the Lands themſelves, but onely to the Profits of them.</p>
            <p>Before <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> Biſhops could enjoy no Lands: for even in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his raign, the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> himſelf, <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> and his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates in the Miniſtry, were fain to hide for ſafety of their Lives, in the Hill <hi>Saracte,</hi> about twenty miles diſtant from <hi>Rome,</hi> ſince called, <hi>Monte di Sylveſtro;</hi> as by that very <hi>Donation</hi> appeareth. Nor did that Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour endow the Biſhops with Lands, but onely gave them large Allowan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces out of Lands: for which a voice is ſaid to be uttered from Heaven, <hi>Hodie ſeminatur Virus in Eccleſia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But be it as the <hi>Papalins,</hi> and this Author perhaps, would have it; that ſuch Decrees were made by <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> 1. <hi>Lucius</hi> 1. and others, for enjoying of Lands; yet the very beſt Original Title of Biſhops to Church-Lands, is not from Chriſt himſelf, by vertue of what he ſpake <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. but onely from ſome <hi>Popes</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> His pretended <hi>Vicars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Touching the ſecond Text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.40. it is ſo clearly meant of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles <hi>Ministry</hi> (not <hi>Biſhops Lands</hi>) and of their entertainment for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſupply of Neceſſaries (not for Pomp and State, and of giving them Gold and Silver enough to maintain it) that it may well be wondered (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by a <hi>wiſe man</hi>) with what forehead that Authour could apply that Scripture to Chriſts accepting and owning the Gifts of Biſhops Lands, which in thoſe times, were not ſo much as dream'd of by any Biſhop or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle of Chriſts Ordination.</p>
            <p>All which that Text can imply, is but this, That <hi>he that receiveth His
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49617:9"/> Apoſtles, receiveth Himſelf, and His Father alſo;</hi> by vertue whereof, He and His Father will effectually move the hearts of the Receivers, to ſee that His Apoſtles ſhall <hi>want nothing,</hi> while they are imployed in preaching to them. Which what it can conduce to prove Chriſts acceptante of Lands for a perpetual Maintenance (which by no Story appeareth to be enjoyed) of His Apoſtles, muſt be left onely to Impudence to make forth.</p>
            <p>Nor was <hi>Ananias</hi> and his wife ſmitten, or ſo much as queſtioned, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. for <hi>ſelling</hi> of Lands devoted to God and the Church; but for their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling, and <hi>lying unto God.</hi> For whereas in the firſt receiving of the Goſpel by the preaching of <hi>Peter,</hi> many thouſands were likely upon that very account (at that time) to ſtarve, being hated and perſecuted for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Chriſt; ſuch as were rich ſold their Eſtates, and put all into one common Banck or Purſe, for Relief of the whole Community of Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> pretended to do the like; <hi>they ſold their Lands,</hi> yet brought but part of the price to the Apoſtles, and pretended, that what they ſo brought was the whole. And being queſtioned by <hi>Peter,</hi> whether this were <hi>All,</hi> they ſold their Lands for; they both with impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſtood to their firſt <hi>Lye;</hi> and, for that, were condemned, and ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with death: not for <hi>Sacriledge by ſelling Lands;</hi> but for <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> in making the world believe more then was true; and by defrauding the Church of part of that which he pretended to dedicate unto God, for the Relief of (not Miniſters, but) the poor Brethren, that then held all things in Common: There being then no Lands or Revenues ſold, or ſet forth for Miniſters, nor did theſe Hypocrites pretend unto it. Howbeit, in as much as they pretended to give <hi>all,</hi> and yet <hi>kept back part of the price,</hi> which they profeſſed to devote to that publick Service of God and his People, they are not to be excuſed of Sacriledge; Not becauſe they voluntarily devoted it, without a Command (for Chriſt himſelf, in ſuch caſes of Extremity had commanded the imparting of what might be ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red<note n="q" place="margin">Luk. 3.11.</note>;) but becauſe they had defrauded the Church, and abuſed the world, the Apoſtles, and God himſelf, of what they had with great ſhew of piety and charity, profeſſed freely to give, even when the giving of the whole was not required.</p>
            <p>But that great ruffling flouriſh which this Author makes thereupon, That <hi>generally all the Fathers both of the Greek and Latine Church,</hi> make his <hi>crime to be a robbing of God of that wealth, which by Vow or Promiſe was now become Gods propriety;</hi> is nothing, as to the <hi>aliening the Lands of Biſhops,</hi> or of the <hi>Church,</hi> (which is the point he undertook to prove;) for his crime in <hi>lying,</hi> and <hi>defrauding,</hi> lay not in ſelling or alienating of Lands, but in the <hi>price</hi> of them. And ſo all Expoſitors Ancient and Modern agree: which comes not up to our Authors purpoſe.</p>
            <p>But, whereas he, <hi>pag.</hi> 26. alledgeth <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> as being of the ſame judgment with the Fathers herein: it is worth the noting to obſerve how corruptly he tranſlateth their words which he produceth. <hi>Calvin,</hi> ſaith he, ſpeaking of that fact of <hi>Ananias, Sacrum
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49617:10"/> eſſe Deo profitebatur;</hi> which this man thus tranſlateth, <hi>He profeſſeth that his Land ſhould be a ſacred thing unto God.</hi> And <hi>Beza</hi> too, <hi>Praedium Deo conſecraſſent:</hi> the man and his wife had conſecrated their <hi>Land</hi> unto God. This he doth, to wiredraw that Text, to make it reach to the unlawfulneſs of ſelling of <hi>Church-Lands of Biſhops:</hi> whereas he abuſeth both theſe Authors, and the Text it ſelf, by ſuch a falſe Tranſlation. <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith not, that <hi>Ananias</hi> profeſſeth <hi>his Land ſhould be ſacred</hi> unto God; but the <hi>money</hi> he made of it, ſhould be <hi>all</hi> ſacred unto the <hi>Lord.</hi> Nor can <hi>Beza</hi>'s expreſſion of <hi>praedium,</hi> ſignifie <hi>Lands;</hi> for that were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly to contradict the Text, which ſpeaks it of the <hi>price,</hi> not of the <hi>Land.</hi> Nor is he blamed for <hi>ſelling Land</hi> devoted to God; but, for being falſe in his account of the ſale, which he pretended to make unto <hi>Peter;</hi> yea, unto <hi>God the Holy Ghoſt</hi> himſelf. Oh, what Fig-leaves is Error forced to cover its nakedneſs withal, when called out by Truth to ſhew it ſelf in the open light!</p>
            <p>And, as touching that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.22. <hi>[committeſt thou ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge?]</hi> It is not denyed, but that there is now ſuch a ſin as <hi>ſacriledge,</hi> under the Goſpel in the New Teſtament; that it is as odious in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, as ever it was in a Jew; and is more immediately a tranſgreſſion againſt God, than other ſins againſt the ſecond Table. But ſtill this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor begs the queſtion in extending this to <hi>Lands,</hi> while he produceth no proof or inſtance at all for ſuch an Interpretation. Yea, thoſe very inſtances which he alledgeth out of <hi>Iraeneus</hi> and <hi>Origen,</hi> refer to <hi>goods,</hi> not to <hi>Lands.</hi> And, what he adds, <hi>[viz. So, the Fathers generally]</hi> muſt, by his own inſtances laſt mentioned, be limitted to what himſelf hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged out of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Origen.</hi> Elſe, it were ridiculous to ſay, <hi>So the Fathers generally,</hi> if they ſpeak in another ſenſe.

            <p>But whereas this Author, to prove Gods propriety by voluntary gifts, not commanded, gives inſtance in the Temple, as a thing accepted and owned, but not commanded of God; he was ſurely aſleep when he did it. Did not God fore-tell, and fore-Ordain a Place which himſelf <hi>ſhould chuſe to cauſe his name to dwell there? Deut.</hi> 12.11. And if our Authour do not take upon him to be <hi>wiſer then Solomon,</hi> he muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs this to be meant of that very <hi>Temple.</hi> For ſo <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf calls it the place of which God had ſaid, <hi>My name ſhall be there,</hi> 1 Kin. 8.29. And albeit <hi>David,</hi> for that <hi>he had been a man of war, and had ſhed blood,</hi> 1 Chro. 28.3. was forbidden to build that houſe: yet <hi>Solomon,</hi> by Gods expreſs appointment (which hath the force of a Command) was choſen to build that <hi>Houſe,</hi> ver. 6. Who could imagine ſuch frothy ſtuff to prove his ſecond Propoſition, of Gods propriety in things voluntarily given, without a command, could fall from the bold pen of ſuch an high-flown Author?</p>
            <p>He alſo confidently affirmeth,<note n="r" place="margin">Pag. 29.</note> that to ſay, <hi>That God accepts of money that Land was ſold for, and not of the Land it ſelf</hi> (and inſtanceth in the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49617:10"/> very caſe of <hi>Ananias</hi>) is contrary not only to all reaſon, and practiſe of all the world; but, to what God <hi>himſelf hath expreſſed in the Old Teſtament:</hi> this (in his ſenſe) is ſo falſe, that it cannot but aſtoniſh a modeſt Reader that knoweth the truth, to finde him ſo boldly to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm what there is no foot-ſtep for in all the Old Teſtament: As ſhall now appear in the enſuing Diſcourſe, wherein that Authors Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies ſhall take up no more room. To return therefore to the proof of the firſt branch of the point before undertaken, <hi>That there is no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in Scripture, for giving Lands to Biſhops, nor proof of Chriſts accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of them;</hi> take notice,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Aaron</hi> himſelf, were prohibited to have any Inheritance in <hi>Lands</hi> by divine Lot, <hi>among their Brethren</hi>
               <note n="s" place="margin">Num. 18.20.</note>. And this was to be <hi>a Statute throughout their generations for ever</hi>
               <note n="t" place="margin">ver. 23.</note>. The Reaſon was given before unto <hi>Aaron, I am thy part and thine inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, &amp;c.</hi> That is, his portion in <hi>Tythes and Offerings,</hi> due from <hi>Iſrael</hi> unto him, ſhould be theirs.

               <hi>I have given them to the Levites to inherit, therefore I have ſaid unto them, Among the children of Iſrael they ſhall have no inheritance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Levi</hi> was a Tribe that made up a twelfth part of Iſrael: yet ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful was God to prevent their claim to any <hi>Lands,</hi> by divine Lot, that, when the reſt of the Tribes were <hi>numbred,</hi> in order to their ſeveral <hi>Lots</hi> in <hi>Land,</hi> God gave expreſs order to <hi>Moſes,</hi> not to <hi>number the Tribe of Levi, nor to take the ſum of them;</hi> but, <hi>to appoint them over the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of the Testimony, &amp;c.</hi> Whereby, is more then implyed, that their Office of <hi>Prieſthood</hi> was then a bar to their inheriting of <hi>Lands;</hi> to ſuch eſpecially as were chief among them, and were always to attend the <hi>Tabernacle;</hi> as did the <hi>High Prieſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed the inferiour Prieſts and Levites, being numerous, did not, could not all attend the Altar at once; but had their ſeveral courſes and orders for waiting there. Therefore were they appointed by God, to ſpread all over Iſrael (when their courſes at the Altar were over) to <hi>inſtruct the people in the Law of God</hi>
               <note n="w" place="margin">Deut. 33.10.</note>, in their turns. Which being ſo, there was a neceſſity of preparing ſome places for their own habitation, and ſome ground for their Cattle, which they were to make uſe of, as well for their domeſtick proviſion, as for travelling between thoſe habitations and the Altar, when their turns came about.</p>
            <p>Upon this ground, God by <hi>Moſes,</hi> layd his <hi>Command upon the children of Iſrael, that they ſhould give unto the Levites, of the inheritance of their Poſſeſſions, Cities to dwell in— and Suburbs for the Cities round about, for their Cattle, Goods and Beaſts,</hi> Num. 35.1, 2, 3. But of theſe none were appointed to the High Prieſt, who was always to reſide about the Tabernacle and Altar. His portion, and ſuch as ſerved at the Altar in Perſon, conſiſted in Offerings, and in a <hi>Tenth</hi> of the <hi>Tythes,</hi> which the Levites were to pay, before they ſhared the reſt among themſelves<note n="x" place="margin">Neh. 10.38.</note> But <hi>Lands</hi> he had none.</p>
            <p>And, as for Levites, diſperſed over Iſrael, although they had Cities
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49617:11"/> and ſome Lands: yet God limited both. For the Iſraelites might not give what they would; but, ſo many Cities and no more; ſo much Land about them, and no more. The number of Cities were in all 48.<note n="y" place="margin">Num. 35.2, 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> (among which, ſix were to be <hi>Cities of Refuge:</hi>) the names of all which, and the allotment of them to the ſeveral Families of the Levites, are ſet down in the 21 of <hi>Joſhuah.</hi> Their Suburbs alſo were bounded by a ſet number of Cubites. For ſo God commanded the Iſraelites, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note n="z" place="margin">Num. 35.4.</note>, <hi>The Suburbs of the Cities, which ye ſhall give unto the Levites, ſhall reach from the Wall of the City, and outward, a thouſand Cubites round about.</hi> The Iſraelites might not give, nor would God <hi>accept</hi> one Cubite more; although the Levites were (as is before ſaid) a twelfth part of Iſrael.</p>
            <p>But here take notice, that thoſe Cities were not inhabited by Levites only. Others dwelt therein, and had ſhares alſo in the reſidue of the Lands adjacent as well as they: Only care was to be taken, that in every one of thoſe Cities and Suburbs, ſo many of the Levites as were deſigned to each City, ſhould be firſt accommodated and well provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for: and the remainder, if any were, ſhould ſtill be inhabited by the Owners of thoſe Cities now allotted to the Levites.</p>
            <p>That this was ſo, is evident by the City of <hi>Hebron</hi> (or <hi>Kiriath-Arba,</hi> the City of <hi>Arba</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">The Father of <hi>Anak.</hi> Joſh 15.13.</note>, a Great man, that firſt founded it:) for that City being given to the <hi>Kohathites, who</hi> (among the Levites) <hi>had the firſt Lot</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Joſh. 21.10, 11.</note>, was yet inhabited alſo by <hi>Caleb,</hi> to whom <hi>Joſhuah</hi> had <hi>before given it for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Joſh. 14.13, 14.</note>. Therefore, after mention of diſpoſing <hi>Hebron</hi> to the <hi>Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hathites</hi> by the free Lot of the Iſraelites, it is ſaid, <hi>But the Fields of the City, and the Villages thereof, gave they to Caleb the Son of Jephun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth for his poſſeſſion</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Joſh. 21.12.</note>. Out of which <hi>Fields,</hi> it is manifeſt by the next verſe, that the <hi>Suburbs</hi> were excepted: for theſe <hi>were given to the Sons of Aaron the Prieſt</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">ver. 13.</note>.</p>
            <p>Now then, if Biſhops take upon them (as of late they did) to be above ordinary Prieſts, Presbyters, or Miniſters, as <hi>Aaron,</hi> above the ordinary <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites;</hi> it is as clear as Analogie can make it, that there is no colour or ſhew for a warrant out of the Old Teſtament to inable <hi>Biſhops</hi> to hold any <hi>Lands;</hi> or, for others, to give them: but an expreſs Law againſt it. It is true, that after the <hi>Temple</hi> was built, there was (no doubt) conveniency of habitation, and perhaps of ſome <hi>Lands</hi> for the <hi>Cattle</hi> of the High Prieſt, who is not to be thought worſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, than his inferiours. And when <hi>Biſhops</hi> can make it out, that they are as <hi>Aaron,</hi> above the reſt of Chriſts Miniſters, the like ought be allowed to them, while they continued.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, thoſe <hi>Cities of Refuge,</hi> and the reſt, ſet out for the <hi>Levites,</hi> with the <hi>Suburbs</hi> pertaining to them, for the Cattle of thoſe Levites that were imployed in the ſeveral parts of Iſrael to be <hi>teaching Prieſts</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">2 Chr. 15.3.</note> of the Law of God to the people, (which Lands, by Gods command were not to be <hi>alienated</hi>
               <note n="g" place="margin">Lev. 25.34.</note>;) may, by <hi>analogie,</hi> be a good ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to prove that Lands ſetled upon the faithful and painful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49617:11"/> of each particular Congregation, or Pariſh Church, as <hi>Glebes,</hi> for their habitation, and neceſſary proviſion of Cattle for their uſe, are accepted of God, as <hi>ſacred;</hi> becauſe Himſelf commanded the like for the Prieſts of the Law, who had ſundry other obventions and in-comes by the Levitical Offerings and Sacrifices, which Miniſters now cannot enjoy: and, it cannot be thought that God or Chriſt will be more want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Miniſters of the Goſpel, than to the Prieſts of the Law. And as God forbad the ſale of thoſe Lands vvhile that Prieſthood continued; ſo it vvill accordingly follow, that <hi>parochial Glebes</hi> are not to be ſold from the Church, ſo long as they be imployed for the maintenance of ſuch Miniſters as truly and faithfully preach the Goſpel to the people of thoſe places, where ſuch Lands are given. For the very Churches to which they are annexed, vvere built by men of quality and piety, for the good of the ſouls of the <hi>living:</hi> and thoſe <hi>Glebes</hi> vvere beſtowed, for the incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of ſuch Godly Paſtors as miniſtred unto them the bread of life, ſo far as the Founders vvere able to judge.</p>
            <p>Indeed, vvhere Popes have appropriated them to his <hi>Italian</hi> tools and Creatures, or unto thoſe <hi>Augaean</hi> Stables, the <hi>Monaſteries</hi> erected in height of Popery, vvho never took care to <hi>feed the Flocks of God</hi> in thoſe places; there, they that called themſelves <hi>the Church,</hi> firſt led the vvay to <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> in the point of <hi>Glebes,</hi> by perverting and aliening them from their true uſe, to pamper the bellies of Epicures, and to maintain the State and Pomp of Atheiſts, under the name and habit of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latical Clergie. Let none therefore vvho are of the Prelatical Party, and cry out ſo much againſt <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> blame the late Parliament for ſelling ſome Glebes that had been ſo <hi>appropriated,</hi> and impropriated; for they did but therein follow the ſame path vvhich thoſe carnal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates had trodden out unto them. Which, if it be <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but vvhat the <hi>Papal Church</hi> had taught them to commit.</p>
            <p>If any ſhould dream, that the ſetting out of <hi>the holy portion of Land</hi> about the <hi>Sanctuary</hi>
               <note n="h" place="margin">Ezek. 45. &amp; cap. 48.</note>, ſhewed to <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in a Viſion, (as a type and prophecie of the ſtate of the Churches of Chriſt under the Goſpel,) is both a vvarrant, and command to ſet out <hi>Lands</hi> to be <hi>holy unto God,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the New Teſtament: that would be no other but a manifeſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting and overthrowing of the genuine ſenſe of thoſe Scriptures.</p>
            <p>For, although it be on all hands agreed, that from the 40 chapter of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> to the end of that Book, the main ſcope is to decipher and deſcribe the ſtate of the Church under Chriſt and his Goſpel; yet it is not affirmed by any one Author, that the Temple there intended, and Gods command there given touching the ſetting out of <hi>Lands</hi> for the ſame, are to be underſtood properly according to the Grammatical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the vvords, as if God meant to erect another new material Temple at <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> in <hi>Judea;</hi> and, to revive and eſtabliſh the ſame Levitical Offerings and Sacrifices formerly offered by <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, to be again offered by <hi>Zadock</hi> and others of <hi>Aarons</hi> Order. But,<note place="margin">See <hi>Jun.</hi> in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 40.</note> that all is ſpoken in a figure, and in a ſpiritual ſenſe; yet, under legal
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49617:12"/> expreſſions, and by vvay of alluſion to the material Temple of <hi>Solomon,</hi> as being the moſt glorious inſtance that could then be found, to illuſtrate and moſt lively to ſet forth the far more glorious eſtate, and ſpiritual endowments of the Evangelical Church of Chriſt, <hi>the New Hieruſalem,</hi> vvhich ſhould ſo far exceed that in <hi>Judea,</hi> as the <hi>Heavenly Hieruſalem</hi>
               <note n="i" place="margin">Heb. 12.22.</note> doth the earthly; and, as the <hi>ſpiritual Temples of the living God</hi> do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel that of <hi>Solomon.</hi> Wherefore, to dravv an argument thence, for the conſecrating of Lands in a proper ſenſe for the maintenance and ſtate of <hi>Biſhops,</hi> is not only to proclaim him to be a weak man that doth it, but to publiſh to all the vvorld that there is no ground in Scripture (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is not) to found any Title of <hi>Biſhops</hi> Lands upon.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Original of Biſhops Lands in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </note>The Original then (and by conſequent, the Title) of Biſhops Lands, in this Kingdom, can derive no further or higher than the abuſed magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence and bounty of Princes and others, nuzzelled in ignorance and ſuperſtion, both before and ſince the Conqueſt, in the height of Popery; vvhereby Monaſteries and Cathedrals have been endowed vvith large portions of Land and other Revenues, under the ſpecious pretence of <hi>giving them to God, and Holy Church:</hi> even to the impoveriſhing not of private Families alone, but of the Kingdom alſo. Nor vvere they given indeed to maintain a Preaching Miniſtry, to inſtruct the people in the true knowledge of Chriſt and his Goſpel (for this, moſt of thoſe men that held thoſe Lands ever perſecuted;) but, for Superſtitious ends and uſes; and imployed (for the moſt part) to maintain the Riots, Pomp and State, and other exceſſes and luſts of Abby-Lubbers, and other belly-gods and drones, to the great diſhonour of God, and ſcandal of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is to be obſerved, that the greateſt and richeſt indow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Cathedrals and Monaſteries with Lands in <hi>England,</hi> were made when Satans Throne was moſt exalted, and his Kingdom in greateſt peace, even in times of thickeſt Popiſh darkneſs; when even Kings themſelves, and Nobles ſcarce knew a letter, nor the reſt underſtood any thing of Chriſt or Religion; no, nor of the very Laws of the Nation, but what the Prelatical Popiſh Clergie (whoſe policy and intereſt it vvas to keep all in groſſeſt ignorance) thought fit at ſome ſpecial times, for their own gain and advantage, to communicate. The Clergie being the ſole Maſters of the times, and holding all the chief Offices and Places of Power and Judicature even in the State, as vvell as in the Church, did vvhat they liſt both with King and People. And with their familiar ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Excommunication (the great <hi>Mormo</hi> and ſcare-crow of the Laity) they could and did conjure in to their own and other Churches, what quantities of Lands, or of ought elſe that was beneficial, they pleaſed.</p>
            <p>But in nothing did they exerciſe ſo much tyrannie, as over the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of men, according to what was prophecied by their greatly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Patron and Pillar, St. <hi>Peter</hi>
               <note n="k" place="margin">2 Pet. 2, 1, 3.</note>, who gave warning long before of their wiles and tricks, whereby, <hi>through covetouſneſs, with fained words, they would make merchandiſe of the people.</hi> This they did, not

            <p>And as they kept the people in ignorance, the more eaſily to prey upon them: ſo they purpoſely winked at all their wickedneſs, their adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, rapes, murders and other villanies which they committed againſt others of the Laity, till they ſaw it moſt ſeaſonable to carve large gobbets out of their Eſtates, vvhen they had them ſure vvithin their Nets. Then, they would (to this end) fall foul upon them, terrifying them with unſufferable torments, firſt in Purgatory, and afterwards in Hell it ſelf; unleſs they ſpeedily gave ſuch large portions of their beſt Lands as theſe Harpies pleaſed, to expiate their ſins, and to prevent thoſe miſeries. Which if they did, they were preſently abſolved, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed meritorious; eſpecially, if they could be drawn to give ſo much, as might redeem the ſouls of their deceaſed Anceſtors too, out of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory tortures. By this, they merited Heaven; but, without this, they muſt expect Hell for their portion. Strong Arguments to weak and ſilly Souls abuſed by <hi>blind Guides.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which Donations, they were made to believe were given unto God, and to ſome Saint: whereupon they needed not to doubt of their own pardons, and the releaſe of their Anceſtors out of Purgatory fire, which kept the Kitchins of thoſe ſoul-killing Prelates ſo warm.</p>
            <p>All thoſe Charters muſt (for the better grace of the buſineſs) begin with the Name of God, as if all were given to him, and that he accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereof; meaning, to themſelves, to cramb their purſes and panches, to the uſe of the Devil. Therefore when he or his imps had any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to act, they uſually made <hi>In Dei nomine Amen</hi> [In the name of God Amen] the Preface to it.

            <p>Nor would the Donors have parted vvith ſuch ample Territories, but as being made to believe by thoſe Merchants to whom they gave them, or by their Agents and Factors, that thereby they ſatisfyed God for their ſins, and expiated the guilt of ſome hideous and hainous wickedneſs which they had before committed: or, as hiring the Prieſts and Monks that were to enjoy thoſe Lands to redeem the Souls of their Anceſtors out of Purgatoty, or to curſe their Enemies with <hi>Bell, Book and Candle,</hi> as the manner then was, the more to pleaſe (or rather fool) the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Founders, whom by ſuch means they cheated of ſuch large do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; as any indifferent man vers'd in the Hiſtories of thoſe times, cannot but know.</p>

            <p>Nor were the Kings and Parliaments (eſpecially after King <hi>John</hi>) ſo hood-wink'd and cow'd, as not to take notice of, and provide againſt thoſe exceſſive gifts of Lands to the Church (as they call'd it) which ſo greatly rob'd the Commonwealth.

            <p>Next after <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, ſucceeded his Son, <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt, who confirmed <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> in the 25 of his Reign (and with it the Clauſe or Chapter laſt mentioned:) but before he did that, even in the ſeventh of his Reign, he made a ſtrict Law againſt <hi>Mort-main</hi> (by advice of the Prelates, as well as others) to make all gifts and Purchaſes of Lands (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpecial Licenſe from the King) to be null and void, and the Lands forfeited to the chief Lord, if he took the advantage within a year and half; or elſe to the King, in caſe the chief Lord neglected the ſeizure within the ſaid time therein limited and appointed for his ſeizing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, for his own uſe.</p>

            <p>By all which it is manifeſt, that neither the Kings, nor Parliaments, nor Biſhops themſelves in Parliament, ever took all Lands given to Churches to be Sacred, and Gods Propriety <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> or ſo much as lawful for the Church to hold them, without Licenſe from the King or other chief Lord of the Fee, of whom ſuch Lands were before holden. Witneſs the many Statutes againſt <hi>Mort-Main</hi> (or againſt the falling of Lands into a dead hand, that is, the Church;) whereby neither King nor Kingdom could receive any thing out of them, for Defence of the Realm; nor the chief Lords enjoy the benefit of chief Rents, Services, Fines of Alienation, or Eſchetes; which being an apparent wrong to all, occaſioned thoſe Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes.</p>

            <p>Thus we ſee the Title of <hi>Biſhops Lands,</hi> what it was; and upon what grounds, and in what manner, procured, and enjoyed; vvhich argues them to be (in the conſtruction of Scripture) far from being <hi>ſacred</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> unto God, by ſuch corrupt Dedications; and particularly, of thoſe very <hi>Lands</hi> purchaſed by Doctor <hi>Burges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It remaineth now to make out, That <hi>the aliening, diverting,</hi>

               <hi>or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing ſuch Lands for common uſe (notwithſtanding their firſt dedication) neither is, or can be Sacriledge, or otherwiſe ſinful or unlawful.</hi> This is in great part evident, by what hath been before ſet forth; yet, for more full ſatisfaction, ſomewhat more ſhall be added.</p>
            <p>To begin with the <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Suburbs</hi> of the <hi>Levites,</hi> will be a good ſtep to the clearing hereof. Firſt, their <hi>Houſes</hi> might be ſold, even
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49617:15"/> by themſelves without ſin. For that Law which was made for the <hi>redeeming of it at any time</hi> (which others might not do, that ſold Houſes in a <hi>walled City,</hi> unleſs they redeemed them within the compaſs of the firſt yeer after ſale;) and for the return of it, at the next <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilee</hi>
               <note n="x" place="margin">Lev. 25.32, 33.</note> in caſe it were not redeemed before, plainly implies a lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for any man to buy an Houſe that pertained to a <hi>Levite,</hi> if it were to be ſold; and that it vvas no ſin to detain it, till it vvere either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, or returned at the <hi>Jubilee,</hi> as all other Lands ſold by others were to be. This might be done without the leaſt branding of the ſeller or buyer; Yet thoſe Cities were by Gods own appointment, ſet out for the dwelling of the <hi>Levites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed God forbad the Levites to ſell their Lands; to wit, <hi>the Fields of the Suburbs of their Cities; for it was their perpetual poſſeſsion</hi>
               <note n="y" place="margin">Ibid. ver. 34.</note> It was the ſame in effect vvith our <hi>Parochial Glebes:</hi> and ſo, might not be aliened, or ſold, ſo long as their ſervice and Prieſthood continued. Howbeit, afterwards, vvhen their ſervice vvas ended, and the Prieſtood removed, they might as lawfully ſell their Lands as their Houſes. Elſe <hi>Joſes</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Barnabas,</hi> a <hi>Levite,</hi> had committed Sacriledge, for that he (after Chriſt changed that Prieſthood) <hi>having Land ſold it, and laid down the money at the Apoſtles feet;</hi> which is recorded by the Spirit of God as an eminent act of exemplary piety and charity, and of the ſou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Now, if it were no ſin in him then to ſell, it could not be a ſin in others to buy ſuch Lands, (and other Lands the Levites might then have none) albeit thoſe Lands, by God's own Edict, were to be continued in the Prieſts while their Prieſthood laſted. Can it then be ſo haynouſly ſinful to ſell, or purchaſe Biſhops Lands (which no Law of God ever ſettled upon them) after their Office and Function is wholly taken away?</p>
            <p>But it is happened to ſome of thoſe raſh Cenſurers, as it did to thoſe Oxen, of whom <hi>Columella</hi> (that famous Husbandry-Writer, in the dayes of <hi>Claudius Caeſar</hi>) noteth<note n="z" place="margin">

            <p>And vvhatever ſome think now, that it is <hi>Sacriledge</hi> to aliene any thing once pretendedly dedicated unto God; yet even the Biſhops themſelves in Parliament have thought and determined otherwiſe, as well as Kings and the reſt of the Parliament, in the Acts formerly mentioned; vvherein, eſpecially in one of them<note n="a" place="margin">15 Ric. 2.5.</note> they make all Lands given vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Licenſe, to be forfeited, and to be ſeiſed, <hi>unleſs they procure a Licenſe to amortiſe them, or ſell or alien them</hi> (to ſome other Uſe) <hi>before Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas then next coming.</hi> This ſhews plainly, that albeit it was not held law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for Biſhops, Monks, or others, to <hi>receive</hi> or <hi>purchaſe</hi> Lands in Mort-Main: yet it was lawful (if they had ſo done) to <hi>ſell</hi> them (for the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment directed the ſale) and therefore lawful for others to purchaſe them for common uſes, when once it ſhould be diſcovered that thoſe Lands were ſo given and dedicated as therein was forbbidden.</p>
            <p>To which may be added, 1. That Biſhops Lands eſpecially, were at firſt
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49617:15"/> given to maintain their State and Magnificence, as Lords, with ſpecial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to State-Imployments; <hi>For that the Kings were wont to have the greateſt part of their Counſel, for the ſafegard of the Realm, when they had need, of the ſaid Prelates and Clerks ſo advanced</hi>

That nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in thoſe times, nor ſince, did many of them (yea ſcarce any) take paines to <hi>teach the Law of God to the People,</hi> which was one end for which Biſhops were endowed with ſuch large Revenues, as the Statute <hi>De Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſoribus Benefic.</hi> before cited, expreſly declareth. So that this being neglected, they lived in ſo great a ſin, as (in the judgement of thoſe few of them, who made more conſcience of their Duty in this kind) next to the ſin of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> there could not be a greater. Witneſs that Learned and Zealous Biſhop <hi>Robert Grosthead,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> in the reign of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. who having received a Command from Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Fourth,<note place="margin">Mat.

Which ſin, by moſt evident places of the Scripture, ſuch men are known to commit, who being put into the Paſtoral Office, provide for themſelves of the milk and wool of Chriſts ſheep, that by his appointment were to be vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and ſaved, but do not adminiſter to them their due: for, the not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring of the Paſtoral Miniſtration, is by the Teſtimony of Scripture the ſlaying and perdition of the Sheep.</q> 3. That not onely all their Civil Imployment in State-Affairs (for which they were exalted ſo high,) is wholly taken off by ſpecial Act of Parliament, with the Royal Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent<note n="c" place="margin">17 <hi>Car.</hi> c. 28.</note>; but their very Function and Office, (as Archbiſhops and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, as themſelves and theirs were pleaſed to diſtinguiſh them from, and to ſet them above the reſt of their Brethren in the Miniſtry) hath been ſince by the ſame Parliament pluck'd up by the roots. Therefore their Lands muſt needs Eſchete and revert to the Commonwealth, the proper Heires of the firſt Founders and Donors, being long (yea, many Ages) ſince dead, and their own particular Heires, and Memory periſhed from off the Earth.</p>
            <p>The Parliament therefore had as good right to ſell or alien them to any other uſe, as the firſt Donors had to give them to thoſe uſes expreſſed in their ſeveral Donations; or as that Parliament in 15 <hi>Ric.</hi> 2. (which had the conſent of the then Biſhops in Parliament) had to appoint or permit all ſuch as had gotten any Lands, without Licenſe, to ſell or alien them to private uſes; or, as any particular Lord in chief (by the ſame Act of Parliament, <hi>Ric.</hi> 2.) had to ſeize and ſell any ſuch Lands ſo given, if fallen
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49617:16"/> unto him by ſuch Forfeiture and Eſchete. So that now, it is no more Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge or ſin, to buy and enjoy Biſhops Lands, after the final and total abolition of Biſhops, then it was for <hi>Joſes</hi> (or <hi>Barnabas</hi>) the Levite, to ſell his Lands; or for any man at this day to buy any of thoſe Suburbical Lands of thoſe forty eight Cities, heretofore ſet out for the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites.</p>
            <p>This might ſuffice, if it were not ever too true of ſome, <hi>non perſuadebis, etiamſi perſuaſeris,</hi> Thou ſhalt never perſwade me to be of thy Opinion, although by Reaſon thou ſufficiently convince me.

Our Biſhops would none of this. Nothing ſounded ſo harſh in their Ears, as a <hi>Parity.</hi> This was not onely <hi>Schiſme,</hi> but <hi>Hereſie,</hi> in their Conſtruction. They claimed a Power and Dignity (even by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right) above other <hi>Presbyters</hi> or <hi>Ministers,</hi> as a diſtinct Order from, and ſuperiour to that of <hi>Presbyters:</hi> And that in the two greateſt points of Authority. For, they appropriated <hi>Ordination</hi> and <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> ſolely to themſelves, and to their Officers in their Right; which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly contrary to the Teſtimony of Scripture, both touching Ordination, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.1, 2, 3. and Juriſdiction, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.3, 4, 5. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6, 7, 8. <hi>&amp; verſ.</hi> 10. And as upon this Account, they looked upon themſelves (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the beginning of that Parliament, which after threw them out; witneſs that Book of <hi>Epiſcopacy by Divine Right,</hi> written by <hi>Joſ.

Since which time, none of them have vouchſafed to aſſert their Title to be <hi>Jure Divino.</hi> If therefore the Levites, who had a clear plea for their <hi>Divine Inſtitution,</hi> juſtly loſt their Lands, and other Revenues, with their Offices; there can be no ſcruple of conſcience to buy or enjoy Biſhops Lands (whoſe Title was never ſo good as that of the Levites) after the Biſhops themſelves be laid aſide for ever, as Uſurpers over the Miniſtry, as well as over the reſt of Gods <hi>Heritage.</hi>

For which purpoſe, he firſt minded them of the Third part of the <hi>Publick Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily against the Peril of Idolatry:</hi> wherein it is ſaid of the Primitive Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, <q rend="margQuotes">That they were preaching Biſhops, more often ſeen in Pulpits, then in Princes Palaces; more often occupied in His Legacy, who ſaid, <hi>Go ye, into all the World, and preach the Goſpel,</hi> then in the Embaſſages and Affairs of Princes.</q> After which, he recited an old <hi>Canon,</hi> of the ſixth <hi>General Council in Trullo,</hi> with <hi>Zonaras</hi> his Note upon it: which Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non enjoyned Biſhops <q rend="margQuotes">To preach often; at leaſt, every Lords day; or to be Canonically admoniſhed, for their neglect: whereupon, if they refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not, they were to be excommunicated or depoſed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>For this, ſome of his Prelatical and droniſh Auditors informed the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> againſt him, who forthwith complained of the Doctor to the King himſelf. Shortly after, he was by Letters Miſſive ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned into the High Commiſſion Court, (then, little better then the <hi>Spaniſh Inquiſition</hi>) to anſwer this haynous Crime. Upon his appearance, Articles were exhibited againſt him, as being diſ-affected to the Book of Common Prayer, the Ceremonies, and Government of the Church; as alſo for charging the Biſhops with conniving at the then too palpable growth of <hi>Arminianiſm</hi> and <hi>Popery,</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">Act. 12.</note> and their too much conforming thereunto, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But chiefly, <q rend="margQuotes">For that he ſeemed to tax and accuſe divers Prelates and Reverend Biſhops of this Kingdom, for neglecting to preach often: and for alledging to that purpoſe, that the ancient Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops were frequent and diligent Preachers; quoting an old Canon, that every Biſhop ſhould preach every Sunday; and if negligent here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, he ſhould be admoniſhed; upon which, if he reformed not, he was to be excommunicated or depoſed: without conſidering their many and weighty Affairs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This, made them ſpurn ſo furiouſly againſt him, that their Party every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where gave it out, that he ſhould be both <hi>Deprived</hi> and <hi>Degraded.</hi> And doubtleſs it had been ſo, had he not given them enough in his Anſwers to their cavilling Articles, and in his Proteſtation annexed to the Copy of that his Sermon delivered to <hi>Archbiſhop Land,</hi> who after peruſal thereof, never troubled him further, he having profeſſed to ſtand to what he had ſaid in that Sermon, againſt all Oppoſers to the Death.</p>
            <p>This was the third time wherein the Doctor was called into that Court. Once<note n="g" place="margin">
                  <hi>An.</hi> 1622.</note> he was brought thither by a potent Adverſary (who had made a ſtrong Party againſt him) for being diſ-affected to <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Government, &amp; for permitting ſome, <hi>to ſit, at receiving the Lords Supper.</hi> Another time<note n="h" place="margin">
                  <hi>An.</hi> 1629.</note> he was queſtioned there, for refuſing upon a Thurſday (he being then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted to preach the Lecture at St. <hi>Mary Overies</hi> for the then Lecturer
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49617:17"/> there) to read Common Prayer in his Surplice and Hood, before the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: On purpoſe to deter Godly Miniſters from preaching Lectures.</p>
            <p>And as they thus grew incorrigibly negligent in the duty of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry (here and there one or two black Swans excepted) ſo did they as much over-laſh in another extrem; being too pragmatical and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in Civils. Inſomuch as by reaſon of ſome affronts put upon one or two of them as they were going to the <hi>Houſe of Peers</hi> aſſembled in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, many of them privately drew up a Proteſtation, which they after delivered, (contrary to the Priviledge of Parliament) to the King, not to the Parliament it ſelf, againſt all Acts and Proceedings in Parliament, in their abſence, as <hi>null and voyd.</hi> This high Act of theirs drew upon them the hatred and ſcorn not only of their ſuppoſed enemies (who as yet had done them no harm,) but of their friends alſo; yea, ſo did it incenſe all againſt them, it that occaſioned the throwing them, firſt, out of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and then, out of their Epiſcopal Office and dignity for ever.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>4</label> The laſt and moſt generally-taking Objection is this: <hi>Be it that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops are juſtly caſhiered, their Lands forfeited, and rightly taken from them by the Parliament: Yet it is generally held by all ſound Divines, that thoſe Lands and Revenues (although at firſt ſuperſtitiouſly, or ſuperfluouſly given) being once dedicated unto God, may not be aliened, ſold, or diverted to any ſecular or common uſe; but ever continued for the maintenance of the true worſhip of God,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This objection is plauſibly received among honeſt Godly men; Yet is capable of Anſwer, thus:</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label> 1. This opinion is not in the caſe of Biſhops Lands, founded on the Scripture; but upon that commonly received maxime caſt in the Popes mint; <hi>Semel dicatum Deo non est ad humanos uſus ulteriùs transferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum.</hi> Which wherein, and how far forth it holds good, hath been above declared, and need not to be repeated. Things once given to God, by his command, warrant, or approbation, may not be aliened to other uſes, vvhile the uſe of Gods appointment doth continue: But, not all that men pretend, or ſay, <hi>they give unto God.</hi> As in <hi>Perſons,</hi> ſo in <hi>things,</hi> ſuch only as the Lord chuſeth, or accepteth (and none elſe) are <hi>holy</hi>
               <note n="t" place="margin">Num. 16.7.</note>, let men ſay and think vvhat they vvill to the contrary. To pin therefore Biſhops Lands upon God, becauſe once pretendedly given to him, is like thoſe gifts of the Iſraelites in the abſence of <hi>Moſes,</hi> pretended to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto God, vvhen <hi>they brake off the golden ear-rings which were on their ears, and brought them unto Aaron, to make them Gods to go before them</hi>
               <note n="u" place="margin">Exod. 32.3.</note>. They intended them as gifts to the true God, as they thought; yet were thoſe gifts far from acceptance with him; or reſerved for holy uſes, after the folly and wickedneſs of the Givers vvas diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and puniſhed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is apparent that thoſe gifts to Biſhops were to be no longer continued, than the function of thoſe to vvhom they vvere given, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained: <hi>Datur Beneficium propter Officium;</hi> Office and Benefice are relatives; like twins, they live and die together. The Biſhops ſhare in the goods and Lands of the Church, hath been for many hundred yeers ſevered, and known from the reſt of the Churches Patrimony that vvas to maintain others; and ſo cannot be claimed by others, vvhen the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Order and Office is taken away.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When the vaſtneſs of the Revenue, or unlawful procuring of it, is a vvrong to the Common-wealth, or to any particular Family; this is not a <hi>dedication</hi> to God, which he will own; but an abuſing of him, by fathering upon him the acceptance of that, vvhich is a vvrong to others;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49617:18"/> and a profaning of his name, by teaching all to take that for a vvarrant, to deny to others their due. That poſition therefore now urged, vvould be of dangerous conſequence, if taken univerſally and vvithout due bounds.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Things voluntarily dedicated, by Gods own appointment, cannot be aliened. If it hath been abuſed, that muſt be rectified, and the things continued, for ſome other holy uſe, although not at firſt intended by the Donors. Thus, the <hi>Cenſers</hi> abuſed by <hi>Korah</hi> and his Companions, were no more uſed for <hi>incenſe;</hi> yet, <hi>becauſe they were hallowed, they were converted into broad Plates to cover the Altar</hi>
               <note n="w" place="margin">Num. 16.37</note>. But in things not appointed by God from the beginning, this Tenet holdeth not. For, being dedicated upon falſe grounds, &amp; for ſuperſtitious ends (moſt derogatory to God and Chriſt) to maintain, feed, and encreaſe the pomp and pride of Harpies that <hi>lay in wait as he that ſetteth ſnares and traps to catch men</hi>
               <note n="x" place="margin">Jer. 5.26.</note>, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to fool them out of their eſtates upon falſe pretences, for ends of their own; this <hi>dedication</hi> is no vvhit better, than <hi>the hire of a whore, or the price of a dog,</hi> (that is, then money gotten by whoredom, <hi>or by the ſale of a dog,) brought into the Houſe of the Lord,</hi> and dedicated to him; both which, he <hi>abhorreth</hi>
               <note n="y" place="margin">Deut. 23.17</note>. Such are all thoſe gifts of Lands dedicated to God, firſt gotten by rapine and ſpoyl; or, to put Chriſt out of office of ſaving ſouls, and to do it by ſuch gifts. He looks no otherwiſe upon them, then as <hi>the offering of ſwines blood,</hi> the <hi>cutting off of a dogs neck,</hi> or <hi>the bleſſing of an Idol</hi>
               <note n="z" place="margin">Iſay 66.3.</note>. When it can be proved that God accepted of ſuch offerings in time of the Law, then alſo it may be granted that he vvill own ſuch mongrel Dedications in the days of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Things dedicated to God, vvithout his order and allowance, is a <hi>laying aſide</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Mar. 7.8.</note>, <hi>and a rejecting the Commandment of God</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">ver. 9.</note>, and a <hi>making the Word of God of none effect</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">ver. 13.</note>. It is the Phariſees <hi>Corban</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">ver. 11.</note>, which they <hi>(for filthy lucres ſake)</hi> taught children to plead, and thereby to break the fifth Commandment) when required to relieve aged and needy Parents. If a father demanded ought of his ſon, and his ſon anſwered, This is <hi>Corban,</hi> a gift devoted to God, therefore you muſt excuſe me; Vows muſt be paid, and things once dedicated muſt not be recalled or aliened: This, by the Phariſees Doctrine, vvas ſo <hi>ſacred unto God,</hi> that (if the child ſhould be willing to pleaſure his parent with ſome part of it) <hi>they would ſuffer him no more to do ought for his father or mother</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">ver. 12.</note>. Did Chriſt take this for a dedication that might not be aliened? nay, he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred it, and them that taught it. Such are all dedications of mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions and fancies, vvithout a Rule from him: <hi>And therefore to be alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to other uſes,</hi> that God may no longer be abuſed and provoked by them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The ſame thing hath been for many yeers, and ſtill is done every day by the greateſt Cenſurers of the preſent Purchaſers of Biſhops Lands. Even they who now cry loudeſt againſt buying Church-Lands (becauſe once dedicated to God) and make it high Sacriledge in others, can yet be content and quiet to hold things of the ſame kind (in reſpect of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication) heretofore aliened from the Church.

            <p>How many Nobles and Gentlemen who now cry <hi>Sacriledge</hi> againſt preſent purchaſers, do poſſeſs many Lands and Mannors of Biſhops, alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated ſince <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth began to deſtroy <hi>Monaſteries?</hi> Many of thoſe Lands being by ſecret (I ſay not <hi>Symoniacal</hi>) compact between Petitioners for Biſhopricks, and their friends at Court, exchanged, or otherwiſe aliened from the Church, upon condition to get ſuch a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick for them. If any doubt hereof, it is his ignorance; let him but inquire into that one Biſhoprick of <hi>Bath and Wells,</hi> and he will finde, that ſince the 30th of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. the Mannots of <hi>Wokey, Blackford, Compton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dando, Congersbury, Yaton, Chew, Wike, Puckle-Church, Weſter-Leighe, Hampton, Claverton, Cranmore, Ever-Chritch, Kigsbury, Chard, Welling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Lidford, Compton Parva,</hi> and <hi>Chedder</hi> (to omit many <hi>Appropriati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Hundreds, Burroughes, Farmes, &amp;c.</hi>) have been alienated from that Church, before ever the late Parliament ſeiſed the reſt; and are to this day held by Lay-men, to their own private uſes, without ſcruple or blame. Yea, this is not the firſt time that the Mannor of <hi>Wells</hi> hath been alienated from the Church; for in <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. it was aliened by the Biſhop himſelf to him that was afterwards <hi>Earl of Hertford</hi> and <hi>Duke of Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet;</hi> and by him held without clamor, until by his attainder it eſcheted to the Crown, and thence returned to the Biſhop again.</p>
            <p>Nor is there any ſcruple made of purchaſing thoſe many <hi>Canonical Houſes</hi> in <hi>Wells,</hi> which formerly belonged to the Church; yet, were a part of the <hi>Biſhops Land and Mannors of Wells,</hi> and are held of the ſame Mannor unto this day; yet none of the Poſſeſſors hold it to be any fault in them, while ſome yet condemn the ſame thing as <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> in Doctor <hi>Burges,</hi> albeit he performeth more ſervice in that Church than any Biſhop that ever ſate there.</p>
            <p>Let not ſuch think to waſh all off, by ſaying theſe were things done before their times, which they could not help; for, they can without ſcruple enjoy, yea purchaſe them.

            <head>THE SECOND PART, Declaring The <hi>Differences</hi> between Dr. <hi>Burges</hi> and the <hi>Corporation of Wells,</hi> With The <hi>Neceſsity</hi> thereof, on his part.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Octor <hi>Burges</hi> is not (in common repute) ſo weak, as not to apprehend the great diſadvantage which a ſingle man hath in encountring a <hi>Corporation,</hi> wherein there are ever ſome Spirits that pretend to ſee further into, and to be more zealous of the good of that Community, than the reſt, thereby to engage them in Controverſies; and that others of them, gaining thereby, will not fail to add fewel to the fire, when once the coles are kindled between a vvhole Body, and any one particular man that ſhall be ſo hardy as to oppoſe them, (although ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo juſtly) concerning any thing unjuſtly done by them. Inſomuch as it is taken for a maxime among ſuch, (if they have a minde to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs) that many ſubtle heads combined, a common Purſe (to make great Friends, and to impoveriſh and weary a ſingle Adverſary;) and the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of obtaining Juſtice againſt them, is enough (in their conceit) to juſtifie their greateſt frauds and oppreſſions; and to proclaim and doom him the only Offender, that dares to ſeek Juſtice againſt them. This hardens them in their wickedneſs, and draws into common obloquy and reproach, any one that (being neceſſitated to maintain his own rights) ſhall preſume to queſtion their fouleſt encroachments.</p>
            <p>This, the Doctor hath found, in proſecuting the <hi>Differences</hi> here after related. Wherein, he firſt appeared, in behalf of the Parliament, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diſcovered ſundry groſs vvrongs done to the State by ſome Agents for the Corporation of <hi>Wells.</hi> Afterwards, he vvas enforced to purſue the ſame conteſt, in behalf of himſelf, being by the <hi>Contractors for ſale of Biſhops Lands,</hi> and by the then <hi>Committee of Parliament for removing Obstructions</hi> in ſale thereof, drawn to purchaſe the <hi>Mannor of Wells,</hi> and what elſe there then remained unſold; vvhich they promiſed he ſhould quietly enjoy.</p>
            <p>Hence ſprang all the Differences between him and that Corporation, vvhich (to his great grief) have been ſadly ventilated almoſt ten yeers,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49617:20"/> notwithſtanding his utmoſt endeavours to compoſe them in vvays of love and peace. The firſt Riſe and Sum of all vvhich, is now expoſed to publike view, that they vvho have been abuſed by falſe and ſcurrilous clamors againſt him, may now be better able to judge vvhich Party hath indeed been in fault, in cauſing or occaſioning the beginning and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of thoſe unhappy Contentions.</p>
            <p>In publiſhing vvhereof, it vvill be requiſite to advertiſe, that it is not here intended to rip up all the particular affronts and injuries done to the Doctor; but only to ſet forth: 1. What vvas the Original of all the Differences between them; and how that hath been ſince pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted. 2. That what is after alledged in reference to any former Mayors of <hi>Wells,</hi> is not imputed to their own perſonal averſneſs from peace, but as they have been the mouth of the reſt that have put them upon vvhat they have ſpoken or acted herein. 3. That albeit this Narrative often mentioneth the vvhole Corporation, yet it is not meant to involve all alike in the ſame Charge; ſome of them being better inclined to reaſon and peace. 4. That the <hi>Contractors</hi> vvere the firſt Plaintiffs in this Cauſe; not the <hi>Doctor.</hi> He vvas only forced afterwards to undertake the ſame buſineſs, upon the ſame grounds and evidence vvhich the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractors had done before: for that the Corporation refuſed to make good the engagement of their Agents made not only to the ſaid Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors and Committee of Parliament; but, to the <hi>Doctor</hi> himſelf, under their Hands and Seals, after he had been drawn to be a Purchaſer at <hi>Wells.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the better underſtanding of the whole buſineſs, take notice, That an Agent for the <hi>Corporation contracted</hi> for certain Royalties, in <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1647. but perfected not the Conveyance until the 22 of <hi>March</hi> then next following; and that Dr <hi>Burges</hi> did not purchaſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til <hi>March</hi> 16. 1648. and that then he bought many things (ſome of them being of great value) which the <hi>Corporation</hi> by general words, and by ſurpriſe and fraud had before gotten into their Conveyance, without contracting for them at all. How, and by what meanes they did it, is firſt to be laid open; and then the courſe uſed to right the Common-Wealth, and the Doctor therein.</p>
            <p>After the Surveyors had made a return of their <hi>Survey</hi> of the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Burrough,</hi> and <hi>Hundred</hi> of <hi>Wells,</hi> one <hi>John Caſebeard,</hi> a <hi>Burgeſs</hi> of <hi>Wells,</hi> took upon him at firſt (without Order) to treat with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractors for ſale of thoſe Lands, in the name of the <hi>Corporation</hi> of <hi>Wells,</hi> for the purchaſe of certain <hi>Royalties</hi> of the late Biſhop of <hi>Bath and Wells;</hi> upon which the ſaid <hi>Contractors</hi> granted this Warrant following.</p>

            <p>This Contract, ſo refers to the firſt Particular, that without ſight of that, no man can ſay punctually what was purchaſed: but rather what not was purchaſed, till that particular be produced. And whereas the Contract mentions the Bayliff-wick to be but 5 <hi>l.</hi> 13 <hi>s.</hi> 4<hi>d.</hi> improvement, after three Lives in being, it agreeth not with the <hi>Survey,</hi> which ſaith it is 40<hi>l. per annum.</hi>

            <p>This Contract lay (as the Contractors thought) ſleeping, from the 15 of <hi>December,</hi> till the 15 of <hi>March</hi> following. In which time, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents of <hi>Wells</hi> ſlept not; for they being told by ſomebody, that if they could but get the firſt Particular out of the Regiſters hands, and draw up and return another in the room, they might get much more into their Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe and Conveyance, then they had indeed Contracted for. Which ſome, imployed in this Purchaſe, accordingly did. And in room of the firſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, the Particular here following (without any new Contract or war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from the Contractors) was thruſt in, and brought to the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors (<hi>March</hi> 15.) to ſigne. The Contractors, being by Ordinance of Parliament to look no further then to the Regiſters hand affixed to the Particular, for their Warrant to ſigne the Contract made thereupon, they then uſed not to have the whole read again, but onely the ſums for the Purchaſe to be paid; how much in Poſſeſſion, and how much in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and how many yeers Purchaſe for both. Which done, they ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and gave their Warrant to the Truſtees, for paſſing a Conveyance accordingly.</p>

            <p>According to which Warrants, the <hi>Truſtees</hi> ſealed a Conveyance of all the Premiſes to the Mayor, Maſters and Burgeſſes of <hi>Wells</hi> aforeſaid, word for word as the ſame is above expreſſed in the ſaid forged <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</hi> Which Conveyance bears date, <hi>Mar.</hi> 22. 1647. and being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled in Chancery, needs not here to be recited.

               <note place="margin">How Dr. <hi>Burges</hi> fell into theſe bryars, and eſpouſed the States quarrel with that Corporation.</note>
            </p>
            <p>About <hi>July</hi> 1648. Doctor <hi>Burges</hi> (having no hope to get his money (lent to the Parliament) in kinde) reſolved to take it out in Biſhops Lands. This being made known, ſome Parliament-men and others uſed all importunity to draw him on thereunto. Whereupon ſeveral Purchaſes were propounded to him; as <hi>Witney</hi> in <hi>Oxfordſhire; Muncton-Farly</hi> in <hi>Wilts. Thornton-le more</hi> in <hi>Lincoln-ſhire;</hi> Another place in <hi>Warwick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, Paddington</hi> in <hi>Middleſex, Banwel</hi> in <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> &amp;c. In every of which, ſome perſons of note got before him.</p>
            <p>At length, the ſame Parties that had propounded thoſe other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, put him upon buying the Mannor of <hi>Wells;</hi> to vvhich he vvas very hardly drawn, partly becauſe many peeces thereof had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſold by parcels to others, which might occaſion differences to an after Purchaſer, and partly by reaſon of other great diſadvantages that accrew to him that ſhould purchaſe a Biſhops <hi>Seat;</hi> but chiefly, becauſe he ſaw it would coſt much more than all his moneys lent to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. Howbeit, through the inceſſant perſwaſions of friends, he did yeeld to make that purchaſe. The manner of his Proceeding in it, is here firſt briefly ſet down upon Oath made by a then Parliament man, that vvas very active for the State in diſcovering the frauds of the Agents of the Corporation of <hi>Wells,</hi> as he vvas a Member of that <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Parliament for removing Obſtructions,</hi> who ordered him ſo to do; And then followeth a more full Narration of the vvhole.</p>

And it being conceived that it would be for the ſervice of the Parliament to engage Miniſters, and eſpecially the ſaid Doctor, in the purchaſe of thoſe Lands, it was thought fit to put him upon pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing the Mannor of <hi>Wells,</hi> parcel of the Poſſeſſions of the late Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Bath and Wells,</hi> and of all elſe, there, then uncontracted for; the Contractors declaring that they, having made divers ſales of ſundry parcels thereof before, reſolved to make but one contract more for all then unſold.</p>
                  <p n="2" rend="margSglQuotes">That the Doctor being told hereof, ſaid, he would firſt go to <hi>Wells</hi> and ſee it; and afterwards, wrote to this Deponent to purchaſe it for him. This Deponent thereupon deſired a <hi>Particular</hi> thereof to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract upon. But before any <hi>Contract</hi> ſigned, the ſaid Doctor told this Deponent, and the ſaid <hi>Contractors,</hi> that having informed himſelf of the <hi>Conveyance</hi> to the <hi>Corporation</hi> of <hi>Wells,</hi> made almoſt a yeer before, he found that divers things now put into his <hi>Particular,</hi> were paſſed before to the ſaid Corporation; and therefore he refuſed to <hi>contract,</hi> till thoſe things were cleared; ſaying, he would not purchaſe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſuites in Law, inſtead of Biſhops Lands; or words to that effect.</p>
                  <p n="3" rend="margSglQuotes">That the ſaid Contractors taking this into conſideration, and finding it to be ſo, they firſt (as this Deponent hath credibly heard) wrote to the ſaid Corporation to rectifie the ſame in a fair and friendly way; which they not doing, the ſaid <hi>Contractors</hi> Certified the ſame to the <hi>Committee of Parliament for removing Obſtructions,</hi> as a great obſtruction in ſale of the ſaid Mannor, praying their ayd for redreſs.

                  <p n="5" rend="margSglQuotes">That the ſaid Dr. (as appeared to the ſaid Commiſſioners) being ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied herewith, deſired this Deponent to <hi>Contract</hi> for the ſame; which he accordingly did: and the Dr. Signed the ſaid Contract, paid in his purchaſe-mony, and had a <hi>Conveyance</hi> thereof Sealed before the 25 of <hi>March</hi> 1649. as this Deponent beleeveth, to which he referreth for more certainty.</p>
                  <p n="6" rend="margSglQuotes">This Deponent further depoſeth, that the Sub-Committee of the ſaid Committee of Parliament, having drawn up and certified the State of this buſineſs to that Committee, the ſaid <hi>Corporation</hi> in <hi>April</hi> following (as this Deponent hath heard and beleeveth) did impower ſome of their Members to treat with the ſaid Committee of Parliament, and to end the ſame. But, this coming to nothing, the ſaid Committee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſafe cuſtody <hi>John Casbeard,</hi> as one of the Agents of the ſaid Town of <hi>Wells:</hi> and fining yet no ſatisfaction, they Ordered <hi>the ſaid Caſe to be reported to the then Parliament as it was, if ſatisfaction ſhould not be given in one month.</hi> And this was done (as he remembreth) in or about <hi>May</hi> 1650. he being then a Member of the ſaid Committee, but referreth himſelf to the ſaid <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Report.</hi>

But afterwards the ſaid <hi>Liſlibone Long</hi> told this Deponent, that the ſaid Corporation did not like the Agreements. After which, this Deponent heard nothing more hereabout from that Corporation.</p>

            <p>This being certified, It was Ordered that a Sub-Committee ſhould draw up a Report of the whole buſineſs, to be by that Committee Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to the Parliament, in caſe the Town of <hi>Wells,</hi> (ſome of them confeſſing the truth of that Certificate) ſhould not forthwith relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh and reconvey the reſidue unduly thruſt into their Conveyance. And then the ſaid Contractors, and Committee of Parliament preſſed Dr <hi>Burges</hi> to go on with the purchaſe of the <hi>Mannor of Wells;</hi> vvhich he accordingly did. For on the 16 of <hi>March</hi> then inſtant, he contracted for the Mannor of <hi>Wells,</hi> and for whatever elſe was then unſold that belonged to the late Biſhop of <hi>Bath and VVells</hi> in or about <hi>VVells,</hi> in right of his ſaid Biſhoprick.</p>
            <p>But before the Contract was ſigned, Colonel <hi>Web</hi> came to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractors with a Meſſage from the Truſtees, to deſ re them to beware what they did in ſelling the Mannor of <hi>Wells,</hi> and what elſe was the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops there; for that thoſe Truſtees were informed that there were divers things belonging to the ſaid Biſhop in and about <hi>Wells,</hi> that were not ſurveyed. Doctor <hi>Burges</hi> then deſired him to inſtance what thoſe things were; but none could be given. Whereupon the Doctor, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving before met with ſome, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that, ſo ſoon as they heard he was about that purchaſe, ſought to deter him from it, he took it to be ſome Artifice of theirs, to hinder his preſent proceeding. Therefore he firſt appealed to the Contractors and Regiſter, whether they could upon a bare ſuggeſtion, refuſe to ſign a Contract made according to Ordinance of Parliament? They anſwered, <hi>No.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doctor <hi>Burges</hi> then offered, that, whereas divers purchaſes of ſeveral things in and about <hi>Wells,</hi> had been made before his, if the Contractors
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49617:27"/> would engage to allow him a Repriſe for whatever ſhould appear to be ſold before, or not to be part of the premiſes for which he now Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, he would enter an engagement to them to pay for whatever more than was then Surveyed, ſhould be after (within a fixed time then to be agreed upon) diſcovered, according to the rates at the <hi>Contract</hi> agreed upon. Provided he might have his Conveyance in ſuch compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive words, as might take in all, without a new Deed of purchaſe. The <hi>Contractors</hi> conſented, and ſet ſix Moneths for the time of diſcovery. Dr <hi>Burges</hi> then ſigned the <hi>Contract,</hi> with this clauſe in it. On the 19 of that Moneth, the <hi>Contractors</hi> ſigned the <hi>Contract,</hi> which was to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, according to the <hi>Particular,</hi> therefore they took no notice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in of this Agreement. Yet, for diſcharge of their Truſt, they after certified it to the <hi>Truſtees,</hi> and gave the Doctor a Duplicate thereof, ſubſcribed with their own hands, in theſe words:

            <p>All this notwithſtanding, nothing was offered nor done herein by the Corporation. Sundry Overtures and Letters were addreſſed to them by the Doctor, for an end. Divers References were made, wherein, two ſeveral times, all buſineſſes were agreed. But the Corporation reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to part with nothing: for having made friends, who underſtood not the caſe, to ſtand by them therein, they encroached dayly upon the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors <hi>Waſts, Commons, Pounds, Eſtrays,</hi> &amp;c. threatning more. Eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſince they ſo ſtrongly engaged ſundry of the Souldiery (who were ſet to keep peace, not to intermeddle in differences, or to become par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in them) by ſweating three Officers of one Troop (who had not any foot of Land, or other Eſtate within that Corporation) <hi>Burgeſſes</hi> of their Town. Then, Belly-gods, and every rayling <hi>Shimei</hi> gladly made it their buſineſs to run up and down to Gentlemens Houſes; yea, any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whither, where any good chear was to be had, to make the Doctor odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by falſe reports, where they ſuppoſed they could command belief of their confident tales. Yea, ſo far did ſome proud Wiſelings of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction proceed, that if any friend were but in any neighbourly manner familiar with the Doctor, or invited any of his to their Houſes, they would take occaſion to quarrel them for entertaining their enemies: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that ſcarce any perſon of quality durſt to own the Doctor, or to come near his houſe, much more to own his cauſe. All which, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor bore, with what patience he could; knowing, that nothing but Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles and Bryers can be expected from Dung-hills.</p>
            <p>That which remaineth, is a brief account of proſecuting that Report which was to have been made to the Parliament: but never could find opportunity to be reported there.</p>
            <p>An Act paſſed, <hi>Octob.</hi> 12. 1652. to enable the preſent <hi>Commiſſioners for removing of Obſtructions</hi> (among other things) <hi>to hear and determine all ſuch reports of particular Caſes, as by the late Committees of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Obſtructions were ordered to be made to the then Parliament.</hi> Which <hi>Act,</hi> gives them that power that never was in the Committee of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for <hi>Obſtructions,</hi> or in any <hi>Court of Judicature,</hi> but onely in the Parliament it ſelf, to redreſs thoſe abuſes that otherwiſe, in an ordinary courſe of Juſtice, were not to be cured.</p>
            <p>This Act, the Doctor for two or three years made no uſe of; in hope the Corporation would at length be drawn to do him right; becauſe ſuch as were diſcreet and moderate among them, on all occaſions profeſſed themſelves very inclinable to peace. But they fruſtrated his expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for the more he bore, the more was laid on him; which opened his eyes to ſee that they who began upon trifles, would (when they ſaw their time) proceed to ſeiſe upon more; yea, upon all that their
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49617:34"/> 
               <hi>general words</hi> might include. And this was no leſs, then all he had; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the <hi>ſoyl</hi> of the Mannor. For, they might on the ſame ground carry all his <hi>Rents, Fines</hi> for <hi>Copyholds,</hi> and <hi>Leaſes, Forfeitures, Lot-Lead,</hi> all his <hi>Courts</hi> of the Mannor; and, in a word, whatever elſe he could make one penny profit of. And all this, becauſe it was <hi>within</hi> the <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi> of <hi>Wells,</hi> and late the <hi>poſſeſſion of the Biſhop of</hi> Bath <hi>and</hi> Wells, <hi>in right of his ſaid Biſhoprick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt difference began on their ſide, upon a ſmall buſineſs: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, their ſetting up Pens for Sheep at a <hi>Fair,</hi> againſt his Walls, in a place called <hi>South-over,</hi> which belonged always to him that kept the <hi>Biſhops</hi> Park, purchaſed by Dr. <hi>Burges.</hi> Of this, when he had complained, the Corporation ſent up a Certificate that they had made little of it, and that it ſhould be reſtored, if it appeared to be the <hi>Doctors</hi> right. This being but a trifle, the <hi>Doctor</hi> paſſed it by, without farther conteſt.</p>
            <p>After this, the Corporation claymed, and took fifty couple of wild Fowls due to the Biſhop from the <hi>Decoy</hi>-pool near <hi>Weſtbury,</hi> becauſe, within the <hi>Hundred</hi> of <hi>Wells.</hi> Which Fowls had been rated and ſold to the Doctor, at 25 <hi>s. per annum.</hi> He being made acquainted therewith, forbad payment of any more to that Corporation: So alſo did, one Captain <hi>Bagnal,</hi> that after bought the Mannor of <hi>Weſtbury.</hi> The Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or their Agent, hereupon complained to the Committee of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament for <hi>Obſtructions,</hi> for wrong done to them in denying theſe Fowls. Their Petition was preferred in the year 1651. as followeth.</p>

            <p>By this it appeareth, that however the Corporation had bought onely
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49617:34"/> the Royalties of the Burrough and <hi>Hundred</hi> of <hi>Wells,</hi> they meant to graſp all within the <hi>Hundred,</hi> that had been the Biſhops. This alſo the Doctor then paſſed over, without much ſtruggling, albeit the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractors Certified to that Committee of Parliament; and afterwards, to the <hi>Commiſſioners for Obſtructions,</hi> that they had ſold thoſe <hi>Wild fowls</hi> to Doctor <hi>Burges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not long after, they began to claim ſome Chambers over the <hi>Priſon</hi> parcel of the Biſhops Houſe, (and never uſed with the Guild-Hall or Priſon) upon pretence of their purchaſe of the Guild-Hall and Priſon: which in the Report before cited, is denyed; and, by the ſaid Committee of Parliament, <hi>Feb.</hi> 11. 1649. declared to be within the Doctors Purchaſe, of which they ordered him poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>After this, they ſeiſed his <hi>Pound</hi> in <hi>Southover,</hi> diſcharged his Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ſet another in the room, and have ever ſince detained it, and all Waives and Eſtrays at any time brought thither; reſolving to keep it, although it be upon part of the Waſt of his Mannor, and was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver poſſeſſed or uſed by the Bayliff of the Burrough, but by the Reeve of the Mannor, till they ſo ſeiſed it; as appears by many Depoſitions of record in the High Court of Chancery, which make it parcel of the Mannor.</p>
            <p>Nay, they wanted not ſome, who gave our that the <hi>Lot-Lead</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Minedeep,</hi> which was rated and ſold to the Doctor at 80 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> belonged to that Corporation. Yea, one of the moſt moderate among them told the Doctor, that it was conceived that all Fines alſo impoſed by his Mineral Juries on Offenders upon <hi>Mendip,</hi> that were awarded to him as Lord of that Liberty and Mannor, belonged to the Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by vertue of their ſaid Purchaſe. By all which it is evident, that they began with trifles, in hope the Doctor would not ſtand upon ſuch poor things, which if they carryed, the way was open (when they ſaw opportunity) to proceed further, and to carry all the reſt; which ſome among them did not forbear to threaten, and that loudly enough, as many perſons of credit yet alive can teſtifie. And wherein ſoever he did but queſtion them (not by Suites at Law, but by Diſcourſe onely) they proclaimed him covetous, contentious, and one that claimed what was theirs, not his.</p>
            <p>The Doctor now found it high time once more to endeavor to bring things to ſome iſſue and Concluſion in his life time, to prevent the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoydable Oppreſſions, which otherwiſe would after his deceaſe, in all probability light on his Family, who knew little of the Difference, and leſs, how to defend their Right againſt ſuch Adverſaries. He therefore reſolved before he began any Suite at Law againſt the Corporation, to write once more to a Leader among them (and a chief inſtrument at firſt of all theſe differences) Mr <hi>Thomas Salmon,</hi> in hope that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Magiſtrate of the Town, and (in common repute) an honeſt man, would do his endeavour to put an end to all Controverſies; the rather, becauſe he was one of their Atturneys and Deputies to make and ſeal the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49617:35"/> Agreement with the Doctor above recited. For the non-performance whereof, the Doctor had before called him and the reſt into the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery; where, in their Anſwer, the Corporation denyed their Letter of Attorney, as to ending any differences with the Doctor; and <hi>Morgan</hi> and <hi>Salmon,</hi> in their Anſwers, pleaded they were ſurpriſed; which is a groſs untruth. The Letter which the Doctor wrote, was this:

            <p>They anſwered the 27. of that Moneth by their <hi>Town-Clerk John Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh</hi> (as ſcorning, or aſhamed to give it themſelves) That the Doctors Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had been offered and read to the Maior and the reſt at their Chequer, to which they commanded him to give this Anſwer.</p>
            <q rend="margSglQuotes">
               <p n="1">That they were ſorry that there was a difference at any time between him and them; ſuppoſing that what ſo was, was cauſleſly ſtarted by him, without any wrong done, or intention thereof to be done to him by them; but that on the contrary he thereby intended their injury, by intruding on their proper Rights and intereſts; which likewiſe is ſuppoſed he very well knew.</p>
               <p n="2">That they in their own concernments, are as diſpleaſed as he, that this frivolous<note n="*" place="margin">250 <hi>l. per an.</hi> is but a trifle with them.</note> and contentious jar hath received no full concluſion as yet; notwithſtanding the many References, wherein the ſeveral Refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rees
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49617:35"/> have not failed on their parts to do the Offices of very loving friends with their unwearied pains and ſtudies; which what they have both done and ſaid, might ſatisfie, if the reſtleſs humors of ſome men might once receive ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p n="3">That they directly know not, who was at the charge of the Referrees meetings, imagining that <hi>Mr. Morgan</hi> in his life would neither ſo much undervalue the Corporation or himſelf, as to be beholding to you as it were their Common Enemy, for half a meals meat. But, if he did, and made you a promiſe, you muſt look after it.</p>
               <p n="4">That as they were not Authors of the breach at firſt, ſo neither are they willing to imbrace any thing that may widen the ſame, if it may be poſſible to be cloſed. But if it may not be, they are reſolved to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves in their own propriety as well as they may.</p>
               <p n="5">That as he remembreth mortality in his Lines, ſo that he would put the ſame in ure in the paſſage of his life, in being content with his own, and not diſturb the quiet of others with vexatious ſuits; that their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Corporation and his preſent ſelf, and future poſterity may be, and continue friends.</p>
               <p n="6">That they intend <hi>nothing leſs,</hi> then really to perform what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion either the joint Counſel, or Referrees ſhall indifferently conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of, or adjudge between them and him. But, whether there yet hath been an end made, and writings accordingly drawn up and ingroſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or where ſuch ingroſſment is, they as yet know not. But promiſe that Mr. <hi>Morgan</hi>'s Study ſhould be forthwith ſearcht after it.</p>
            </q>
            <p>This was Declaration enough of their purpoſes to hold all that they had ſo fraudulently gotten into their Deed of Purchaſe. What will not ſuch men ſpeak of the Dr. to others, that can have the forehead to write thus to himſelf, to juſtifie themſelves in ſeizing upon what they never bought; and, to charge him with intruding on their proper Rights and Intereſts, for demanding his own, as both the Contractors and Committee of Parliament had expreſly declared long before?</p>
            <p>They confeſs ſeveral References, and juſtifie the Referrees; and tax the Doctor as not ſatisfied with what the Referrees had done: whereas the Agreements made, were ſent down to themſelves, and there ſtifled and buried: their Referree, Sir <hi>Liſlibone Long</hi> having told the <hi>Doctors</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferree, that the <hi>Corporation did not like thoſe Agreements,</hi> as is before at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted upon Oath. Let any man judge where <hi>thoſe reſtleſs humors,</hi> that will <hi>not once receive ſatisfaction,</hi> are lodged.</p>
            <p>And is it not a peece of great honeſty and gallantry (well becoming ſuch a Corporation that would by no means be undervalued) to charge the Doctor, to be their <hi>Common Enemy,</hi> and to put him to bear the whole charge of the Referrees meetings; and then, to tell him, that <hi>if any promiſe were made for repayment, he might look after it:</hi> that is, where he could get it. Whereas the promiſe was made by one of themſelves in behalf of all, in their own buſineſs; and, by their own appointment, Referred.</p>
            <p>They indeed, in the cloſe, deal plainly. For, in this anſwer of theirs,

They tell him, <hi>That they intend NOTHING LESS then really to perform what Concluſion either the joint Counſel, or Referrees ſhall indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently conſider of, or adjudge between them and him.</hi> And verily, this only he hath found to be true all along. Therefore finding a neceſſity of it, he did commence a ſuit againſt ſome of their Officers and Agents, in <hi>Hillary</hi> Term 1655. in which he and the <hi>Defendants</hi> joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed iſſue: but he forbore the Trial, to ſee if by any fairer way he might at length reduce them to Reaſon.</p>
            <p>But, before that time, even in the end of the yeer 1654. after he had received that anſwer laſt mentioned from the Town, he Petitioned the Honorable <hi>Committee for removing Obſtructions,</hi> to <hi>Hear and Determine the Report that was to have been made to the Parliament</hi> in this Cauſe, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Power given them by that Act of Parliament, <hi>Octob.</hi> 12. 1652. <hi>Summons</hi> being granted the 9 of <hi>May</hi> 1655. they appeared, and were heard <hi>June</hi> 20. then next following.

            <p>The things he ſtood upon to have, were, All their claim to, and title and intereſt in any part of the Mannor of <hi>Wells,</hi> with the Rights, Members and Appurtenances; and himſelf and Tenants to be vvholy freed from all Juriſdiction of the Corporation: alſo the <hi>Guild Hall and Priſon,</hi> vvhich ever belonged to the Lord of the Mannor, and vvas not really purchaſed by them, nor could be, it being not returned till after their Contract: all hawking, hunting, fiſhing, fowling, vvithing his Mannor: all Pounds, Waives and Strayes there, all Deodands, Felons Goods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> happening on his Mannor, the Ways and Streets, and ſoyle thereof, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all Courts Baron, and Minery Courts within his Mannor.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Doddington</hi> asked if this were all? the Doctor anſwered, <hi>Yea:</hi> then ſaid Mr. <hi>Doddington,</hi> We will have an end of theſe to your content: I will come again to <hi>Wells</hi> this Summer, and put a Concluſion to it. But he came not. Whereupon Doctor <hi>Burges</hi> waited upon him at <hi>Lincolns-Inn,</hi> about the midſt of <hi>October</hi> following; and it was there agreed, that on <hi>Friday</hi> ſeven-night after, Mr. <hi>Doddington</hi> ſhould come to the Doctors lodging, and make a full end of all.</p>
            <p>But before that day, the Town ſent up by Mr. <hi>Standiſh</hi> and <hi>David Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi> a Letter of Atturny dated <hi>Octob.</hi> 22. 1655. to Authorize him, them and ſome others to anſwer all the Doctors complaints, and Objections: to buy the Burrough rents, Baylywick and whatever was then unſold: but not one word of ſubmitting to the <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tractors:</hi> taxing the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor with cauſleſs conteſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and juſtifying themſelves in all that they had claimed and uſurped.</p>
            <p>Being come to <hi>London,</hi> they forthwith acquainted <hi>Mr. Doddington</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; and no perſwaſions of his for ending of the <hi>Controverſies</hi> in the way wherein he and the Doctor agreed, could prevail; but, before the Doctor knew any thing of their intentions of a new purchaſe, they Contracted, upon the 26 of <hi>October</hi> then inſtant (which was but the fourth day after the date of the Letter of Attorney) for the <hi>Bayliffwick,</hi> the <hi>Guild Hall and Priſon,</hi> the <hi>Burrough</hi> Rents, and ſeven <hi>Canonical Houſes</hi> in <hi>Wells</hi> (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed within the Doctors firſt purchaſe; and which he often offered to pay for, had it been accepted on the terms contained in his firſt Contract) ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver giving him notice that he might have been heard, as they had been ordered to do, <hi>June</hi> 21. 1655.</p>
            <p>This now began more Broyles and ſharp Contentions on their parts,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49617:38"/> which were after tryed at the <hi>Common Plea's Bar,</hi> where the Doctor had fair Juſtice done him by the honourable Court, and Jurors. Howbeit, by the failer of ſome Witneſſes who came not; but eſpecially, by means of a deſperate Oath made by one that was a party, who knew what he ſware to be falſe, a Verdict and Judgment paſſed againſt the Doctor, and he was thereupon outed of thoſe Houſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the Narration of the foul carriage of the Agents of that Corporation in that whole buſineſs, is not here intended. Onely this may be taken notice of, that whereas they were referred to a Trial at Law, by the Commiſſioners for Obſtructions, <hi>June</hi> 23. 1655. upon the account of their ſaid ſecond purchaſe alone; they, at the Trial, produced onely their firſt Conveyance dated in <hi>March</hi> 1647. to prove their Title to the Chambers over the <hi>Priſon;</hi> and, upon that, carried them (even after thoſe rooms had been adjudged to the Doctor by the Committee of Parliament for Obſtructions, in the year 1649.) albeit they had not, till ſeven years after, indeed purchaſed the Priſon under thoſe Chambers.</p>
            <p>With this Conqueſt, the Corporation, their Agents, Officers and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants vvere ſo fleſht, that now they ſuppoſed they might do any thing againſt the Doctor; inſomuch as it grew to a common ſpeech, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hath any trial vvith him, may be ſure to carry it, be the Cauſe what it vvill. And upon this account, their Agents came upon his Land, took away a Mare (vvhich they might, vvith as good vvarrant, have robbed him of) upon an illegal Preſentment, touching the repair of a Bridge (of vvhich he never heard word, till the time ſet for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing, vvas expired:) for vvhich Mare he took a Replevin, granted by their own Steward; but Mr <hi>Mead</hi> (the arch-incendiary between them and him) denyed the execution of it, and cauſed the Mare to be kept in a ſecret place vvhere the Doctor might not come at her, nor know where ſhe vvas.</p>
            <p>Doctor <hi>Burges</hi> vvaited a while, to ſee if the Corporation vvould right him. But they owned all; for having kept her from him, from <hi>July</hi> 1657. till <hi>April</hi> 1658. they then ſold her. And, vvhen the Buyer (fearing belike, he might be queſtioned) craved a Certificate of his buying of her, This Certificate was given him.</p>

            <p>Not content with this, they endeavoured to draw in one <hi>Amur,</hi> a young fellow of very mean condition, that newly ſet up the Trade of a Carpenter, or mungrel-Joyner, to buy not onely the Guild-Hall and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49617:39"/> Priſon, but the Chambers or Rooms over the Priſon. The Doctor hearing of it, ſent for him, and let him know, it would not be ſafe for him to purchaſe things in Controverſie: and that, albeit they had gotten it by a Trial at Law, yet he meant not ſo to give it over.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amur</hi> thank't the Doctor for this friendly premonition, and promiſed not to purchaſe it. But afterwards he vvas ſo far drawn in, that he did purchaſe the ſaid <hi>Guild-hall, Priſon</hi> and <hi>Chambers</hi> over it (as he hath ſince ſaid) of the ſaid Corporation, (who had forfeited that, and all the reſt of their ſecond purchaſe, above two yeers before.) And vvhen he had got Poſſeſſion of it, he did ſo affront the Doctor, both in vvords and deeds, as (it is doubted) vvill in the iſſue fall too heavie upon himſelf. And for all, he pretends the Order and Warrant of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration.</p>
            <p>Theſe affronts, ſeconded with perpetual ſcorns, deriſions, and ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, (eſpecially by one <hi>Bridger,</hi>) inforced him upon mature advice, to commence ſome Suites at Law againſt their Agents; yet not one half ſo many, as their bold Town-Clerk, and Mr <hi>Mead, more ſuo</hi> (it being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon) averred to the <hi>Commiſsioners for Obſtructions,</hi> in <hi>June</hi> 1658.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Doctor,</hi> remembring how much it ſtill concerns him to <hi>ſeek peace and to purſue it,</hi> even vvhen it flies moſt from him, forbore a Tryal at Law for that preſent, and petitioned the <hi>honourable Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners for removing of Obſtructions,</hi> to hear and determine all differences between him and that Corporation. Summons thereupon iſſuing, in <hi>May</hi> laſt, The Corporation, by their Agents and Counſel appeared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſaid Commiſſioners, the 23 of <hi>June</hi> laſt, and were heard.</p>
            <p>

            <p>This, by his Lordſhips direction was brought to him <hi>Jul.</hi> 1. of which he deſired a Copy to be given by himſelf to the other ſide; which was done, and delivered to them ere he Signed the Paper before ſet down: for he did not Sign it until <hi>July</hi> 5. So ſoon as the Doctor got home to <hi>Wells,</hi> he gave notice thereof to the Maior; and ſhortly after, attended the Maior at his houſe for proſecuting of this courſe. Their Recorder and Town-Clerk, then preſent, ſaid, that they told the Lord <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brow</hi> when they received the Paper from him, that as touching the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes by them recovered at Law (the trial being to be final, by conſent) the Corporation could not refer them, becauſe there was now no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them and the Doctor; and therefore no Reaſon they ſhould be referred: and that his Lordſhip thought ſo too.</p>
            <p>To this the Doctor anſwered, that his Lordſhip ſpoke nothing to him of ſuch an exception, when he Signed the Reference, after they had ſo ſpoken unto him. But he muſt inſiſt upon thoſe, as now the chief diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: becauſe albeit the Trial was by conſent, to be final; yet this was only to aſſure the Court in which it was tried, that they ſhould be no more troubled therewith: nor did he ever conſent upon ſuch an account, that if the Cauſe were carried by a falſe Oath (as that was) he ſhould never ſeek juſtice elſewhere: it being very well known, that no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent or Order in one Court, can bind up any man from ſeeking remedy in another.</p>
            <p>The Maior promiſed to acquaint his Brethren with it at a <hi>Chequer,</hi> which he accordingly did; and having read the Paper of Reference to them Signed by the Lord <hi>Disbrow,</hi> they thereupon made this following Order.</p>

            <p>In the draught of the Bond that was to be ſealed by the Corporation, no particular perſons were named in it; but it runs thus: <hi>We the Maior, Masters and Burgeſſes,</hi> &amp;c. Doctor <hi>Burges</hi> excepted againſt this, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired their ſeveral names might be expreſſed in the Bond: for that a Bond being a perſonal ſecurity, could not after be put in ſuit againſt any perſon or perſons, but ſuch as are here named in it. This ſpent ſome time in
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49617:41"/> Diſpute. But upon the motion of one of the Referrees, it was at length reſolved, That the Bonds then drawn up ſhould be ſealed, <hi>de bene eſſe,</hi> till the Doctor ſhould be ſatisfied by Counſel. And, if Counſel ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare ſuch Bond to be invalid, the Town ſhould ſeal another. Then Mr. <hi>Harrington</hi> was requeſted by the other two Gentlemen (who intended to return to their homes that night) to receive and keep the Bonds on both ſides till the Doctor had at the approaching Aſſizes, or elſewhere, received ſatisfaction from his Counſel. The Bonds were to be ſealed the next morning, and Mr. <hi>Harrington</hi> agreed to receive them.</p>
            <p>On the ſame fifth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the Agents for the Town, when they had read the Differences given in by the Doctor, they excepted againſt the <hi>ſecond,</hi> as being now no Difference, ſeeing it had been concluded by a Trial at Law, which by conſent was to be final. The Doctor repeated what he had before ſpoken in private to the Maior in anſwer thereunto; adding this, That ſo ſoon as the Umpire was choſen, and the Bonds ſealed, they might, if they pleaſed, urge this to the Referrees, without prejudice: for when theſe Gentlemen had heard the reaſons on both ſides, they would eaſily judge whether that were now a difference or not. And if they found cauſe to adjudge it to be none, they knew the Doctor would be faſt enough bound to ſtand to that Declaration as part of the Award.</p>
            <p>This at the preſent ſeemed to ſatisfie: but theſe things were ſo long in debate, that nothing more could be done that day, but onely to order the preparing of the Bonds againſt the next morning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday</hi> being come, <hi>Auguſt</hi> 6. Mr. <hi>Buckland</hi> (who went not home on Thurſday night as he had intended) and Mr. <hi>Harrington</hi> met again in the ſame place, expecting the ſealing of the Bonds. But inſteed thereof, the Maior, the Town-Clerk, and two Gentlemen more of the Town, told the Referrees, That the Corporation had that morning met, and reſolved, That neither now, nor hereafter would they become bound to the Doctor by their perſonal named: and that they were now alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, That their ſecond purchaſe ſhould not be referred as a Difference, but be excepted out of the Reference, in the Condition of the Bonds.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Burges</hi> then preſſed the Agreement made the day before, for altering the Bond, if by Counſel it ſhould be found to be of no force. And next, that the putting ſuch an exception in the condition of the Bond, was not at all mentioned on the Thurſday. And if they excepted that difference, it muſt needs argue their diſſidence in the Gentlemen joyntly choſen to arbitrate the whole; yea, that if before Bonds were ſealed, the Corporation would thus limit and bind up their own Agents, there could not be any hope of their ſtanding to any thing debated and determined by thoſe Gentlemen.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the Doctor drew up and delivered a ſecond paper, at the ſame time, to the ſaid Mr. <hi>Buckland</hi> and Mr. <hi>Harrington,</hi> in the preſence of the other ſide; which Paper contained the ſame Heads of Differences he had given in the day before: whereunto he added the following Lines, <hi>viz.</hi>
